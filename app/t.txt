Even Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher thinks they can win the title.", u'Pure bonkers. Cheerio.', u'Click here for more fixtures, tables and results with our excellent Match Zone', u'The drama is just oozing out the Premier League today! John Stones brings down Marko Arnautovic, with the forward then scoring from the penalty spot in the first minute of stoppage time.', u'Incredible. Just seconds after Watford think they have scored following a Ben Watson corner which was cleared off the line by Hugo Lloris, Spurs go straight down the other end and retake the lead through Son Heung-min.\xa0', u"The only way is down it appears for Aston Villa. Norwich have surely picked up all three points now as Dieumerci Mbokani heads home Wes Hoolahan's cross with three minutes left.", u'Just when Everton thought they had got the job done, Stoke hit back! Tim Howard parries the ball away but Joselu sends it back towards the Everton goal and the top corner with a fine strike.', u'FINALLY we have a goal at the Hawthorns as Darren Fletcher scores his first goal since April with a header from a Craig Dawson cross. Karl Darlow perhaps should have done better with that as the ball squeezed through his hands. Just 12 minutes to play.', u"The woodwork has been struck again at The Hawthorns, but this time it's West Brom going close to an opening goal as Victor Anichebe's header bounces up and hits the bar before Newcastle scramble clear.", u"All eyes on Saido Berahino, who according to Tony Pulis was 'lucky to be on the bench' before the game.", u'The striker is now on the pitch for the Baggies replacing James Morrison.', u'What a game this is! Everton lead for the first time as Gerard Deulofeu sweeps home a low cross following a one-two between Ross Barkley and Lukaku.', u'Somehow it remains goalless at The Hawthorns but Newcastle should have had a penalty after Aleksandar Mitrovic was clearly held back by Jonny Evans inside the box. Appeals fall on deaf ears of the match official though.', u"'Nathan Ake off with a straight red and Watford down to 10. Home crowd not happy but replays show referee Anthony Taylor is quite right. Ake\u2019s tackle on Erik Lamela is late and high, catching him on the knee.'", u"It's level again at Goodison Park and Romelu Lukaku is at the double as he brings down a Tom Cleverley cross before firing home his 15th Premier League goal of the season - taking him level with the division's top scorer Jamie Vardy.", u"Is this a little harsh? There doesn't appear to be much malice in Nathan Ake's high challenge on Lamela, but he doesn't get the ball and instead connects with the Argentine to pick up a straight red card. Watford down to 10 men.", u"Another Kane chance, but this time the Tottenham striker can only head wide from a Kieran Trippier cross. It doesn't look like being the Spurs striker's day.", u"What is happening at The Hawthorns?! It's been all West Brom then Newcastle hit the woodwork...TWICE!", u"First Paul Dummett's header strikes the bar before Fabricio Coloccini hits the post with a back heel.", u'Both sides fancy their chances of grabbing a win in this match. Spurs go close as Christian Eriksen plays in Harry Kane with a chipped pass, but his shot from the angle is comfortably saved by Gomes.', u"Unlike at Selhurst Park, I'm not quite sure how this game is still 0-0. West Brom are all over Newcastle but at this stage cannot find the opening goal.", u'Set-pieces look like presenting the best chance for the hosts, with Karl Darlow looking rather nervous from dead ball situations in the Toon goal.', u'Top save from Lukasz Fabianski who reacts well to keep out a header from Brede Hangeland in what has otherwise been a match lacking many chances.', u"'Mousa Dembele off just before half-time. Didn\u2019t look injured, but hard to imagine Mauricio Pochettino would have made the change at that point if he wasn\u2019t.

Peerless.', u'Famous last words from Matt Barlow at Vicarage Road as Watford have equalised! Odion Ighalo scoring in his sixth straight game after cruising past Eric Dier before applying a tidy finish.', u"Shocking from Gerard Deulofeu. The Everton winger leads a promising attack but after poking the ball past Ryan Shawcross he tumbles to ground with a terrible dive. It's no suprise to see him booked.", u"'Fair to say the relationship between Tim Howard and Everton\u2019s fans is strained at the moment.", u"'He has had a few moments of indecision, which have been greeted by fractiousness. When he caught a cross before, there were some ironic cheers and he replied by sarcastically clapping to the Gwladys Street.", u"'Howard has given Everton 10 years excellent service but Roberto Martinez may feel the situation needs addressing soon.'", u"'Pochettino must be pleased with himself after 30 minutes. The usually vibrant Vicarage Road is subdued because Spurs have crushed the threat of Deeney and Ighalo with their three centre-halves.", u"'Watford\u2019s two strikers have barely had a sniff of goal and look a little short of alternative ideas. Tottenham are one-up in control.'", u"Still no goals at Selhurst Park, but there is a yellow card. It's a big one too as it's for Yohan Cabaye and it will see him miss the Eagles' next match against Chelsea following his foul on Jack Cork.", u'Rob Elliot had to depart before kick-off for Newcastle, now the Toon are hit with another setback as Vurnon Anita has had to be replaced due to injury. He is replaced by Cheick Tiote.', u"'Everton may have equalised but the away end is in fine voice at Goodison Park and no wonder.", u"'Stoke\u2019s football has been excellent and the front three of Bojan, Xherdan Shaqiri and Mark Arnautovic are causing Everton plenty of problems.", u"'Shaqiri\u2019s goal will particularly sting Everton manager Roberto Martinez, who tried to sign the Swiss in August.'", u'More woe for Aston Villa. The visitors fail to clear a Nathan Redmond cross and volleying home is Jonny Howson.', u"'Thoroughly good match developing at the Hawthorns, with West Brom on top but Newcastle carrying a threat.", u"'James Morrison has twice gone very close to scoring, while Boaz Myhill required string wrists to beat away Moussa Sissoko\u2019s strike.", u"'Gareth McAuley also produced a brilliantly-timed tackle on Sissoko to divert a clear opportunity as the midfielder strode into the box on a counter attack.", u"'The weather, meanwhile, is positively mild. Shorts for Newcastle assistant Paul Simpson.'", u'Back come Everton though, as James McCarthy finds Romelu Lukaku with a clever pass before the Belgian striker recovers the scoring touch he lost at Newcastle.', u'4 - Erik Lamela has scored four goals in his last five games in all competitions for Tottenham. Form.', u"Now the goals are coming. There's a mix-up in the Watford midfield and it allows Erik Lamela to steal possession before running through on goal and tucking home a finish past Heurelho Gomes.", u"Remember the stereotype of long ball Stoke City? Forget it! The Potters are playing some incredible stuff these days and take the lead at Everton as Xherdan Shaqiri strikes after combining with Marko Arnautovic. That's his first Premier League goal for the club.", u'Click here for more maps and stats with our excellent Match Zone', u"'Norwich fans are singing, \u2018There\u2019s only one Paul Lambert\u2019 at the Aston Villa supporters.'", u"Given Paul Lambert's terrible tenure at Aston Villa, it's easy to forget the former Norwich manager arrived at Villa Park with a strong reputation having taken the Canaries from League One to the Premier League.", u'West Brom are all over Newcastle as Karl Darlow is forced to make a strong save to deny a 20-yard drive from James Morrison. The Toon are being bombarded with corners early on at The Hawthorns.', u"'Looks like Remi Garde is not as much a fan of Jack Grealish as Tim Sherwood was. First exiled him from the team and he has only one start and one substitute appearance under the Frenchman. He made 11 appearances for Sherwood, eight of those starting.'", u'No chances so far at Vicarage Road but an interesting tactical set-up from Spurs as Eric Dier appears to be playing as a centre-back rather than a holding midfielder to form a back three along with Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld.', u'Will that be enough to stop Troy Deeney or Odion Ighalo? We will see...', u"Eight changes for Swansea remember but it's Crystal Palace looking the fresher team so far as they dominate the early exchanges. Mile Jedinak's header is attacked by Jason puncheon but the Swansea defence manage to clear their lines.", u'Early chance for West Brom. A cross to the back post ends up falling for James Morrison whose shot is cleared off the line by Fabricio Coloccini.', u"Remember to get the most out of our live coverage by following all the action with Sportsmail's excellent Match Zone.", u'It features the latest line-ups, formations, match stats and a handy player comparison tool.', u'In addition there are heat zones for EVERY player as well as detailed maps of all the goals as they go in.

In come Kieran Trippier and Danny Rose.", u"'Nathan Ake is back for Watford, with Ikechi Anya in for Allan Nyom at right-back.'", u'Only keeper Lukasz Fabianski, Ashley Williams and Neil Taylor survive from the side who won 1-0 against West Brom as Jordi Amat, Matt Grimes, jack Cork, Jonjo Shelvey, Kyle Naughton, Marvin Emnes, Mo Barrow and bafetimbi Gomis come into the team.', u'Crystal

Marouane Chamakh', u'Speaking to Sky Sports, West Brom boss Tony Pulis appeared spiky as he admitted that Saido Berahino is lucky to be on the bench having left him out of the starting XI for the eighth straight game.', u"Instead it's Victor Anichebe replacing Rickie Lambert in attack as Stephane Sessegnon also comes into the team which lost 1-0 at Swansea with Craig Gardner dropping out the team.", u'Newcastle United had named an unchanged team, but keeper Rob Elliot has pulled out through illness as Karl Darlow makes his first Premier League start for the club.', u'Tom Cleverley may

guardian [u'\nMichael Butler', u'\n\nMonday 28 December 2015 12.21\xa0EST\n\n\n', u' 5.21pm GMT12:21 ', u'\u201cLifelong United fan here,\u201d writes Matt Richman. \u201cMy thoughts are that a combination of style of play and results (given the lavish investment and no little amount of time) are enough evidence that LVG is not our man. That said, neither is that clown, Mourinho. I\u2019m hoping that Giggs is given a chance until the end of the season, after which I\u2019d like Pep or Pellegrini (who really is a class act). Let me dream, please.\u201d', u'Pellegrini? Agree, class act, but can\u2019t see him trotting across town. ', u' 5.17pm GMT12:17 ', u'R\xe9my is injured. So says Hiddink. ', u' 5.16pm GMT12:16 ', u'Looking forward to seeing Schneiderlin this afternoon. He hasn\u2019t played a single minute since 5 December, but United have lost just one of the 16 matches that the Frenchman has been involved in this season. His last two appearances have resulted in a clean sheet for United. After having \xa325m spent on his in the summer, it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s been given a chance. But he adds bite and legs to a tired-looking midfield today, alongside Schweinsteiger.', u'@michaelbutler18 Finally! The centre-mid trio (Schweini, Schneiderlin and Herrera at no.10) most United fans have been waiting for.', u'Updated at 5.18pm GMT', u' 5.08pm GMT12:08 ', u'\u2018What has been your message to the team?\u2019 LVG is asked. ', u'\u201cWin.\u201d', u'Ah, so turns out that results thing is important. Who knew. ', u' 5.06pm GMT12:06 ', u'\u201cEverything is about results,\u201d says former Chelsea wonderboy and current Manchester United man Juan Mata in a pre-match interview. He starts today on the right of midfield for the home side.', u'Winning is important, but United fans, would you take a 2-2 draw if it came through a display of attacking, free-flowing football? The style of Manchester United\u2019s play, or lack thereof, seems as important as results to some fans. Email michael.butler@theguardian.com or tweet @michaelbutler18, please. ', u' 5.00pm GMT12:00 ', u'Chelsea are without a striker today, in their starting XI and on the bench. Fabregas is ill, apparently, but there is no explanation for why R\xe9my isn\u2019t involved. ', u'.@cesc4official is not involved today due to illness. Full teams news and information available here... https://t.co/fwftFkYExB', u' 4.55pm GMT11:55 ', u'\u201cSpeaking of Liverpool fans, as I am one, the surest sign of shifting fortunes is that I feel sorry for LVG,\u201d emails Hubert O\u2019Hearn. A re-building, injury-wracked squad has a mid-season slump; this is a sackable offence?\u201d', u'I think the sentiment around Van Gaal has more to do with poor transfer policy, the dour style of football and the Dutchman triumphantly leading his team out of the Champions League.', u' 4.47pm GMT11:47 ', u'\u201cPremature half-scarf-buying Unted fans needn\u2019t worry. If Mourinho is appointed manager, he will put the \u201ci\u201d firmly back in United,\u201d zings Peter Oh. \u201cA Liverpool fan, wishing for the dourest of 0:0 draws in this one. Happy New Year!\u201d', u'Happy New Year Peter!', u' 4.39pm GMT11:39 ', u'Rooney is back!', u'Manchester United: De Gea, Darmian, Smalling, Blind, Young, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger, Mata, Ander Herrera, Martial, Rooney. Subs: Jones, Depay, Carrick, Romero, Fellaini, Borthwick-Jackson, Andreas Pereira. ', u'Mikel is back! (and Hazard)', u'Chelsea: Courtois, Ivanovic, Zouma, Terry, Azpilicueta, Matic, Mikel, Pedro, Oscar, Willian, Hazard. Subs: Begovic, Baba, Ramires, Traore, Djilobodji, Kenedy, Loftus-Cheek. ', u'Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) ', u'Updated at 4.52pm GMT', u' 11.12am GMT06:12 ', u'I don\u2019t think that is interesting what they [the headlines] do to me. I have said they have to stick by the facts. The scrutiny is all right for me, I\u2019m used to that. You have to stick by the facts and not rubbish\u201d Louis van Gaal, 26/12/15', u'The last time Manchester United lost five competitive matches in a row, Queen Elizabeth II was 10 years old, Jesse Owens had just won four Olympic gold medals and Nat King Cole had just brought out his first record. That was in 1936 \u2013 a miserable run of defeats for United which included a 6-2 loss at Grimsby Town and a 5-2 walloping to Liverpool.', u'Fast forward to 2015, and after four defeats on the trot, it\u2019s do or die time for Louis van Gaal. Many thought that the Dutchman would not be manager of United for this crucial clash against Chelsea. In his pre-Christmas press conference, he simply walked out. Against Stoke on Boxing Day, he didn\u2019t fare much better. Speculation is rife. The knives are out. If the scarves being sold outside Old Trafford are anything to go by \u2013 which, really, they shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 LVG is a dead-man walking regardless of the result today. We\u2019ll wait and see about that.', u'For better or worse, Chelsea acted decisively earlier this month to dispose of Jos\xe9 Mourinho. A 3-1 win over Sunderland and a 2-2 draw at home to Watford have since meant that \u2026 not a lot has changed. Under Guus Hiddink, Chelsea are still teetering just above the relegation zone, Roman Abramovich is still rich and Diego Costa is still a big man with a good touch and a bad temperament. The Spaniard is suspended today, thanks to a needless, reckless slide tackle in the closing moments of the Watford encounter.', u'The players might be tired, after a rest of just one day, but the festive appetite for watching men kick a ball around and watching slightly older sidelined men wincing and nervously pointing at charts is very much alive. Keep your winter break, we need this, a (hopefully) beautiful game to break up the monotony of Connect Four, 50% sales and staring into the abyss.', u'Kick off: 5.30pm GMT', u'Updated at 5.08pm GMT']

There was a hunger about their performance and a strength of character in the wake of that early blow by Cummings.\n', u"    When Liam Henderson's blocked shot fell at the feet of Cummings, the striker showed what a cool customer he is by calmly scooping the ball over the advancing Wes Foderingham. \n", u"Cummings' stylish chip put Hibs ahead", u'    In that moment fans wondered what Rangers would find - and the answer was emphatic.

I thought we were good value for the win. We had to withstand a little bit of pressure and we got a little bit of luck at the end. We deserved that luck, we haven\u2019t any this season whatsoever.', u'\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see people walking out of the ground with a smile on their face. It was an important win and important to get a reaction after such a poor performance on Saturday.\u201d', u'Wanderers\u2019 Championship status and Lennon\u2019s own future looked precarious after a 4-0 drubbing away at fellow strugglers Rotherham less than 48 hours ago. However, the players responded with a sixth straight home victory over neighbours Rovers and are set to be paid on Tuesday \u2013 with a percentage coming from the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association \u2013 having not received their wages last month.', u'\u201cI think they were smarting after Saturday and they had to show pride in the club and the shirt \u2013 they\u2019ve done that,\u201d added Lennon. \u201cThat\u2019s just one small step, we have to carry that on.

I knew the Middlesbrough game being off was a dangerous thing for us \u2013 being fresh never really entered my brain. We just never did enough to win the game. Since I\u2019ve been here that\u2019s the most disappointing performance.\u201d', u'The visitors came close to a stoppage-time leveller when Tom Lawrence\u2019s effort was deflected against a post, but Lambert added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was enough for us, not at the standard we\u2019ve set. That\u2019s not good enough for us. To have any aspiration to get out of the league you\u2019ve got to perform week-in, week-out.

GOAL-FEST OR GOAL DROUGHT?', u'Just as Diego Costa was looking nearly back to his combative best with two goals against Watford - regaining form or inclination to play after the departure of Jose Mourinho - he is ruled out against Manchester United because of an 88th minute booking at Stamford Bridge.\xa0', u'Which leaves Guus Hiddink with a real headache about where his goals are going to come from. Both Eden Hazard and Loic Remy are carrying minor injuries and Cesc Fabregas did not even travel to Manchester because of illness.\xa0', u'Wayne Rooney\u2019s troubles in front of goal are well documented and his confidence is at an all-time low after Louis van Gaal dropped him to the bench at Stoke on Saturday and his replacement Ander Herrera emerged with little credit from that game.\xa0', u'But with Manchester United\u2019s defence a shambles and Chelsea remarkably meek at the back this season, even the most amateur front line would stand a chance.', '', u'Chelsea defender John Terry will hope his defence can achieve a rare clean sheet at Old Trafford on Monday', u'2. IS JOHN OBI MIKEL REALLY THE MAN?', u'There is a clamour for Mikel to start, with manager Hiddink a known fan having played him in a Champions League semi-final and FA Cup final during his last Chelsea spell.', u'Mikel is also fond of the manager, saying he is like a father figure to the Chelsea players. Under Mourinho, the Nigerian international made just nine starts, despite Chelsea falling close to the relegation zone, but it seems he is being brought back in from the cold.', u'The midfielder, linked with a January move to Turkish side Galatasaray, did a solid job when he came off the bench against Watford to make his 350th appearance for the club, creating a few clear chances.\xa0', u'The Blues\u2019 message boards are divided about whether he should be given a spot in the starting XI and Chelsea\u2019s problems probably run too deep to be solved even by the most reliable servant of the club.\xa0', u'Blues midfielder John Obi Mikel came on at half-time during the 2-2 draw with Watford on Boxing Day', u'3. RULING THE ROO-ST?', u'Van Gaal tried leaving Rooney out and it amounted to a 2-0 defeat by mid-table Stoke, although things did liven up slightly when the captain came on at half-time. The brutal truth is, the Dutchman needs Rooney to somehow recapture his scintillating best to stand a chance of staying in his job.\xa0', u'For high stakes games like this you need your big players and Rooney can still be talismanic on the pitch. There are questions over whether his recent struggles \u2013 just two goals in 14 Premier League matches \u2013 is the result of the 30-year-old being physically exhausted but those close to the club say he is simply tired of Van Gaal\u2019s tactics.\xa0', u"Rooney made a difference when he came off the substitutes' bench at Stoke but by then the damage was done", '', u'4. SINKING FEELING?', u'If the results go against them, the Blues could find themselves in the relegation places heading into the New Year, a new low for a team which lifted the Premier League trophy less than eight months ago.', u'Although the departure of Mourinho seemed to herald an upswing in some individual and collective performances, the relief was brief and the new mediocre reality returned against Watford.\xa0', u'The omens are good for Hiddink \u2013 United have not beaten Chelsea in any competition since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement, a run of eight matches dating back to a 3-2 win in October 2012.\xa0', u'Meanwhile Hiddink has won his last three competitive meetings against Dutch compatriot Van Gaal. All this augurs well for Chelsea but it does mean that if they lose they will plumb new depths.\xa0', u'Eden Hazard was brought down iside the penalty box against Watford but his side did not take advanatage', u'5. MARTIAL LAW?', u'It was mere months ago that this \xa336million signing was being cautiously described as good value for money after hinting at game changing brilliance with four goals in his first four games, but since then his performances have been mostly average.\xa0', u'It seems United spent all that money on a 20-year-old who may develop into a world class player but for now is just bags of potential with a taste for expensive properties and personalised headrests in his supercars. That is a big risk to take.\xa0', u"There are also serious questions about Van Gaal persistently using him on the wing when other experts say he would be much better deployed straight through the middle. \u2018He should be there [in the penalty area], having a one versus one,\u2019 was Thierry Henry\u2019s verdict, \u2018scoring and celebrating. Is it fear? Is it because they have been brainwashed a bit too much? I just don't get it.\u2019\xa0", u'So will Van Gaal bend his own rules against Chelsea? It remains to be seen.\xa0', u'Manchester United forward Anthony Martial (centre) has blown hot and cold during his first four months', '', u'\n                                \tShare what you think\n                                ', u'The comments below have not been moderated.', u'\n                        The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n                    ', u'By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.', u'Copy link to paste in your message', u'Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd', u'Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group']

We had agreed a contract and everything,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cHe is a top manager whatever anybody says and I think he\u2019d have done a wonderful job for us. We tried [J\xfcrgen] Klopp as well but he wouldn\u2019t come because he said he wanted a break. But I\u2019m glad with the manager we have got.\u201d', u'West Ham United will make Manuel Lanzini\u2019s season-long loan from Al Jazira Club in the United Arab Emirates a permanent deal two months earlier than planned, said Sullivan. The Argentinian midfielder, who is currently sidelined with a thigh injury, has scored four times in his 12 Premier League appearances for West Ham this season.', u'\u201cThe contract we have is 100% watertight. We have until April to make it permanent but we\u2019ll probably do it before the due date,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cHe is a fantastic player and a fantastic man.

He\u2019s the best player I\u2019ve signed in 25 years.

Calling birds, four of them no less, are on their way to the Emirates. Desperate measures from Ars\xe8ne Wenger perhaps but lest we forget, this is the Crucial Christmas Period and things for Arsenal are already, well desperate. The names of said birds? First up we have Nolito, Celta Vigo\u2019s \xa315m forward, who is also attracting interest from Barcelona. Wenger has a plan, though, throw in Joel Campbell, shut his eyes and hope.', u'Second we have somewhat of a surprise move for Chicari (No!), Javier Hern\xe1ndez, who is in hot goalscoring form for Leverkusen after Louis van Gaal (more on him later) deemed him surplus to requirements at Old Trafford. Oopsy Poopsy Louis. Third, we have Real Madrid\u2019s 22-year-old benchman Jes\xe9, also piquing the interest of Liverpool, and finally we have Mohamed Elneny, who will jet in from his native Egypt to complete his \xa35m from Basel when the window flings open.', u'Liverpool meanwhile, are set to be almost as busy in January with three key targets. Moussa Demb\xe9l\xe9, not that one, is due to arrive from Fulham, Swansea\u2019s Baf\xe9timbi Gomis has appeared on J\xfcrgen Klopp\u2019s radar with the Swans bracing themselves for bids, and Steve Mandanda may soon be occupying the Reds\u2019 sticks with a \xa33m move from Marseille on the cards.', u'On to the turtle doves hightailing it out of Chelsea now. Cesc F\xe0bregas has met Wenger underneath a railway bridge in the dead of night and has decided it\u2019s time to put PSG and Bayern Munich Inter and Juventus, among a number of other clubs, on red alert. He will be joined at the Chelsea exit door by Lo\xefc R\xe9my, who continues to hang around, scoring the odd goal, collecting his pay packet and generally looking glum.', u'Guus Hiddink will be busy in January, he, and he alone, has decided that Chelsea need a superstar. He has apparently also decreed that Chelsea need to spend \xa330m on Jamie Vardy. (The Mill shuts its eyes, waggles its finger and picks a name from a hat) And the superstar is Paul Pogba, who hasn\u2019t been linked with a move away from Juventus this side of Christmas. Chelsea are also, by the by, in the race for Ante Coric, Dinamo Zagreb\u2019s 18-year-old wunderkind along with Real Madrid and Manchester City.', u'And on to Mr Van Gaal, he of the death stare, who says he may fall on his sword but more likely, have his peartree rattled and be given both barrels by the Manchester United suits, who have locked Bobby Charlton in a disused WWII bunker, thrown away the key and will unveil Jos\xe9 Mourinho at half-time today.', u'In other news, Stoke are chasing Daniel Accam from Chicago FIre, Everton are in hot pursuit of Bournemouth\u2019s Matt Ritchie and Aston Villa will offer Charlie Austin the chance to stay in the Championship next season having made an \xa38m to QPR.']

But even after the Rayo victory, the president of Real Madrid changed his tune. Publicly, he has stopped talking and privately, he has taken action.', u"He has contacted Jose Mourinho's representative, Jorge Mendes.", u'He has taken a poll of his season ticket holders as to whom they think should be the one to replace Rafa.', u"He has weakened the position of Rafa so much that, for many, he's a dead man walking.", u'Perez has concluded that even though he would like Jose Mourinho to come at some point, the former Chelsea boss has still got too many enemies in the squad. He has, however, found out that the squad would back Zinedine Zidane as a manager, were he to get rid of Rafa.', u'Zidane is now the favourite.', u'All that happened while Rafa was on holiday, which, in my eyes, is a little bit ugly.', u"It's quite clear that behind the scenes there has been a lot of movement over the last few days and that leaves Rafa Benitez exposed.", u"Benitez, who knows that four of the next six games are at home and victories could change matters, will be in charge for the game against Sociedad but nobody can tell what's going to happen next.", u"A radio show, El Larguero, discussed a conspiracy theory that the players had told Florentino to get rid of Rafa. It's the kind of thing that gets leaked with the intention to weaken the position of the coach but actually it has helped Florentino because the story that followed was one saying Mourinho could be the one to take charge.", u"There were two reasons, in my eyes, for that story to come out - firstly, so Perez could scare some of the players. The conclusion of the club is that it's not all down to the manager; the players haven't responded as they should have this season so talk of Mourinho coming could have scared them and made them switch on.", u'But the speculation has also helped the position of Mourinho because whoever wants to get him - for instance, if Manchester United are still interested - would think they were in a potential battle with Real Madrid for his services.', u"I can tell you that, at the moment, Mourinho won't be in charge at the Bernabeu, though Perez - as I've mentioned - would certainly like him to return at some point.", u"That's where we are - with a weak Rafa Benitez and Zidane looking like the favourite to replace him.", u"It's a huge task for Rafa now if he wants to survive.", u'The line coming from the club is that he has to improve results, relationships with the players\u2026 everything, really.

bbc ['', u'Twenty-five years ago, in 1990, Germany was reunified, and the state of East Germany ceased to exist. But in the dying days of the so-called Democratic Republic one international football match in Belgium remained to be played. Many of the best players saw no point in turning up - but those who did gave all they had.', u"It was on 12 September 1990 that East Germany's fate was sealed. At a ceremony in Moscow the foreign ministers of East and West Germany and the four occupying powers - Britain, France, the US and the Soviet Union - signed a treaty that brought about German unification three weeks later.", u'As the signatures were drying on the historic document a group of East German footballers were preparing for their own farewell, hundreds of miles to the west, in Brussels. ', u'"I knew that that game would go into the history books. I was proud to be called up and we wanted to go out on a high note," remembers Uwe Rosler, then a 21-year-old striker playing for FC Magdeburg. ', u'Communist East Germany had won more renown on the running track and in the pool than on the football pitch. In the last summer Olympics before the fall of the Berlin Wall - in Seoul in 1988 - it had come second only to the Soviet Union in the medals table.', u'Its best moments in football had come earlier, in the 1970s. ', u'In 1976 the East German football team won Olympic gold, but the victory that mattered most was the one in Hamburg, in the 1974 World Cup, against the class enemy, West Germany.', u'In an exquisite piece of Cold War theatre, Juergen Sparwasser burst into the penalty area, thumped the ball into the roof of the net and turned a somersault in celebration. It was the only goal and the only time the two Germanys ever played each other.', u'But ironically, on the brink of its demise, East Germany had perhaps its strongest team ever. It needed only a draw from its final game against Austria to qualify for the 1990 World Cup. As the squad was about to gather at its training camp, however, in late 1989, the government opened the Berlin Wall.', u'Overnight East German footballers became hot property. Clubs from the West German Bundesliga sensed an opportunity to snap up talent, and the players realised that for the first time in their lives there was the chance of earning serious money. ', u'You can listen to Farewell to East German football on Sporting Witness, on the BBC iPlayer. ', u'"I was in the training camp and it was surrounded by agents," says Rosler. "Players were continually on their phones trying to sort out their futures. The whole focus disappeared."', u"One West German club official actually managed to get on to the substitutes' bench on the night of the game in Vienna, disguised in a photographer's bib.", u'The upshot was that Austria won easily - and that the pick of the crop very soon signed lucrative deals to play in the Bundesliga.', u"In February 1990, East Germany's name went into the hat for the draw for the 1992 European Championship. But as it became clear that East Germany would no longer exist in 1992, the game that had been scheduled against Belgium was redesignated as a friendly. ", u'That created a problem for the East Germany coach, who gradually realised his best players - several by now in the Bundesliga - had no interest in risking injury in what they saw as a meaningless game.', u'Rosler saw it differently. He was still playing in the East German Oberliga, and for him this game was a big opportunity.', u'"We knew there would be a lot of people watching that game, a lot of managers, a lot of scouts from the Bundesliga. For me there was no question of not playing," he says.', u'The players gathered at a training facility near Berlin.', u'"I think there were probably only 10 players there at the beginning - and I remember that the coach and other people from the administration were on the phone all day long," says Rosler. "Every hour we would hear that this player\'s not coming or that player\'s not coming."', u'In total, 22 players turned down the opportunity to represent East Germany, offering an array of excuses. Several said they were injured. Four said quite simply that they lacked the requisite motivation. One claimed not to have a passport, and another said he no longer regarded himself as an East German citizen.', u'There was one notable exception - Matthias Sammer, 23, already an experienced international who was by then under contract to VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga. But even he took a bit of persuasion.', u"Sammer has described arriving at the training camp and realising that none of the other big stars were coming. He says he checked to see if there were any flights back to Stuttgart that evening but found that there weren't. The coach indulged in a bit of arm twisting, told him that he needed him to lead the team and Sammer stayed.", u'"In hindsight, I\'m happy there were no more flights," he says in a German television documentary shown last year, smiling broadly.', u'"Sometimes your good fortune has to be forced upon you."', u'A highlights video shows the group lined up for the national anthems before the game, grim determination on their faces. The squad comprised just 14 players, two of them goalkeepers. Three were making their debuts.', u'"Looking at these pictures, you can see the commitment we showed," says Rosler. "We ran ourselves into the ground. I don\'t think you\'d believe that this was a friendly game from the way that we chased and blocked and tackled. The game meant a lot."', u'Rosler was involved in the build-up to the first goal, which was eventually bundled over the line by none other than the reluctant captain, Sammer. Shortly before the end, Sammer added an elegant second.', u'"I think everyone had massive respect for Matthias," says Rosler. "That he turned up and the way he played was phenomenal. He was a true captain on the day."', u"With victory assured the coach played his final card, a generous one. He sent on his substitute goalkeeper, Jens Adler, for the final seconds. Adler had never before played international football. He never would again. There's a shot of him spitting nervously on his gloves as a corner comes in. But Adler, the very last man to win an East German cap, didn't once touch the ball. ", u'"My one regret," says Rosler, "is that I didn\'t keep my shirt. I swapped it, I think, with their number five. I should have kept my shirt."', u"Three of the team that played against Belgium went on to represent the unified Germany, most notably Sammer, who made more than 50 appearances. Rosler's international career came to an end that night in Brussels. Competition became simply too stiff with East and West Germans vying for a place in the same squad. But he went on to play in the Bundesliga and in the English Premier League for Manchester City.", u"There's a postscript.", u'The East Germans should have played one further game, against West Germany, class enemy no longer, in November 1990 - a celebration of unification a few weeks previously.  ', u"But during crowd trouble at an Oberliga match in Leipzig in early November a fan was shot dead by police, which led to further clashes between police and fans at subsequent matches. The unification game was cancelled for security reasons - and the 2-0 victory over Belgium, with a makeshift squad of 14 men, a reluctant captain and a grateful goalkeeper, became East Germany's international footballing swansong.", u"Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.", u'There needs to be a "complete rethink" of the UK\'s flood defences following unprecedented flooding across northern England, the Environment Agency says.', u'Remember some of those who died in 2015', u'How you can take smartphone photography to the next level', u'Why 2015 was a transformative year in medicine', u'How much attention have you paid to the arts this year?

That\u2019s the aim.\u2019', u'Having drawn in both of their league fixtures with Celtic this season, the obvious question now is how close Hearts can get to the reigning champions in the league table, Neilson insisting that the ultimate goal - a proper title challenge - needn\u2019t be out of reach forever.', u'\u2018The conclusion is we\u2019ve still got a distance to go,\u2019 he said. \u2018We want to challenge.

It is something we can achieve.', u'\u2018You have to show Celtic respect and keep your shape, keep your discipline. Their two goals came from slack play from us, somebody making a bad decision.

But, at other times, we caused ourselves problems.\u2019', u'Discussing Osman Sow\u2019s dramatic late equaliser, Neilson added: \u2018He\u2019s got phenomenal ability and, when he steps up, you always think he\u2019s going to create something. Even when the ball comes into him, you always believe something will happen \u2014 a shot, a cross, something else.', u'\u2018I felt in the first half we played really well. The second half was a bit of a non-event. I\u2019ll take a point. But I\u2019d rather have three.\u2019', u'Goal hero Sow admitted that he owed an assist to Celtic\u2019s Gary Mackay-Steven, explaining: \u2018I hit it quite well and the ball took a bit of a deflection. I was thankful for that.', u"Sow's drive with his left boot, which took a deflection, saved a draw that didn't please the Hearts players", u'\u2018It was important for us as it earned us a point, but I thought we could have had three points or ended up with nothing. Both teams had chances, so maybe one point each is a fair result.', u'\u2018You don\u2019t score unless you try a shot, so I just did my best. I thought we could have won. We were a bit on top in spells, especially in the first half. Celtic came back and put us under a bit of pressure, but we were right in the game.', u'\u2018We fight for each other and everyone is positive. We will see in the next couple of months where it will take us. I have a good feeling. Everyone is working hard and pushing each other.

guardian [u'Contact author', u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 18.52\xa0EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sunday 27 December 2015 19.10\xa0EST\n\n', u'Guus Hiddink\u2019s second spell as interim steward has barely extended beyond a week and, already, he is nursing a headache induced by Diego Costa.', u' Related: Hiddink gets taste of his Chelsea task after Oscar blows late penalty against Watford ', u'Chelsea benefited from the Spain forward at his best on Saturday, all the rampaging power and presence that had originally marked him out as exceptional restored to his game. And yet one needless late lunge, and the resultant fifth yellow card of term, has denied the champions their principal striker at Manchester United on Monday.', u'The Dutchman described it as \u201ca setback\u201d. Privately, he must be exasperated. Such is life with Costa, a player whose aggressive style of play forever carries risk of sanction. This club had been waiting for months to glimpse the 27-year-old who had run riot at the start of last term and, having finally resurfaced, he has been lost again just when he was needed most.', u'Jos\xe9 Mourinho might have warned his stand-in successor to prepare a back-up plan, with Hiddink now left contemplating his options. There is too much doubt surrounding Radamel Falcao\u2019s fitness to send him out against the club where he spent last season on loan, the Colombian\u2019s year-long arrangement with Chelsea having proved, if anything, even less productive than his spell at Old Trafford. Efforts will surely be made to cancel that deal with Monaco next month.', u'Eden Hazard, who was preferred up front when Costa was dropped four weeks ago, is only just back from a hip injury and remains without a club goal since May. His eager cameo against Watford did at least win a late penalty, conceded by Valon Behrami\u2019s wild challenge, only for Oscar to slip and balloon the spot-kick over the bar. But Hazard has trained only three times under the interim and departed complaining of discomfort in his leg yet again. \u201cHe is not top fit yet, but very fresh in his mind,\u201d said Hiddink. \u201cHe\u2019ll need training and, eventually, games.\u201d', u'That may suggest Lo\xefc R\xe9my, a player rarely trusted by Mourinho, is most likely to deputise if he has recovered from his own slight knock. His only Premier League start of the season came at Newcastle in late September. The clean slate of which the new manager has regularly spoken would particularly apply to his under-used Frenchman.', u'Hiddink suggested he had joined the club \u201cin their desperate period\u201d, but at least they travel north with the pressure thrust, for once, on their opponents. United may be 10 points better off than the champions but their recent form is abject, the scrutiny all on the hosts and their beleaguered manager, Louis van Gaal.', u'Chelsea, encouraged by their show of character to recover a deficit against Watford, will consider this an appropriately grand stage upon which to demonstrate their own campaign is on the up. \u201cIf the team had not reacted I would have said: \u2018Phew, there\u2019s a lot to do on the mental part of the game,\u2019\u201d said Hiddink, who will also be without Cesc F\xe0bregas for Monday\u2019s match after the Spaniard did not travel with the rest of the squad to Manchester due to a fever. \u201cBut they did respond to the penalty and a deflected goal, and that\u2019s why we can be confident. So let\u2019s make Monday something nice for history.\u201d', u'Watford are doing that almost on a weekly basis. This was another hugely impressive display, Quique S\xe1nchez Flores\u2019s wonderfully drilled side recovering from Costa\u2019s initial reward to force themselves ahead through Troy Deeney\u2019s penalty and Odion Ighalo\u2019s 13th league goal of the season.', u'Costa restored parity before the end but, even with the penalty conceded late on, a fifth game without defeat was the least the visitors merited. They were energetic, awkward and a regular threat. If they beat Tottenham Hotspur on Monday they will be level on points with Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side at the end of a year of staggering progress.', u'That fixture has particular relevance to \xc9tienne Capoue, outstanding alongside Ben Watson at the heart of Watford\u2019s midfield these days but, in 2013, one of the far from magnificent seven recruited by Tottenham at huge expense in anticipation of Gareth Bale\u2019s world-record sale to Real Madrid. A paltry 19 Premier League starts in two years tells the story of Capoue\u2019s Spurs career.', u'\u201cI didn\u2019t play enough to show my quality at Spurs so that\u2019s why I came here and started at zero with a chance to enjoy and show what I can do on the pitch for Watford,\u201d said the Frenchman. \u201cIt is always the choice of the coach, and I respect I wasn\u2019t good enough for him. No problem.', u'\u201cI had a few options to play in the Premier League but I chose Watford because it was a very big project. I knew the president through my agent, and Gino Pozzo is very clever with big plans in his head. He wants to turn Watford into a top club in a few years\u2019 time. We can do it. We have shown how good we are. We are seventh and, even if we go down a few places before the end of the season, we have shown what we can do with a small club.\u201d', u'There is a long-term vision at Vicarage Road, where Flores is getting the best from players who might have been undervalued elsewhere and have a point to prove. There are examples dotted throughout a Watford team who are seventh on merit.', u'Hiddink, a short-term appointment with immediate problems, may now have to do the same with R\xe9my in the fixture to come.', u'Man of the match \xc9tienne Capoue (Watford)', u'Sign in\nor create your Guardian account to join the discussion.\n', u'This discussion is closed for comments.', u'\nWe\u2019re doing some maintenance right now.

guardian [u'\nJamie Jackson', u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 18.25\xa0EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sunday 27 December 2015 19.40\xa0EST\n\n', u'Louis van Gaal says he is still capable of lifting his Manchester United players but knows that defeat against Chelsea on Monday evening at Old Trafford will likely result in his sacking. Following Boxing Day\u2019s 2-0 loss at Stoke City, Van Gaal, 64, suggested he could resign, but the decision may be taken for him by Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, if Chelsea win. It is believed the pair held talks over the weekend regarding the Dutchman\u2019s future.', u'The loss to Stoke was United\u2019s fourth in a row and a seventh game without a victory. It is 54 years since they last suffered four consecutive defeats and they have won only three times in their last 15 games. They now lie sixth in the Premier League, nine points behind the leaders, Leicester City.', u'Van Gaal dropped the captain, Wayne Rooney, from his starting XI at Stoke, the first time the manager has done so in a league fixture, but the decision backfired because United were 2-0 down by the interval following the poorest half of football since Van Gaal became manager in July 2014. Rooney came on for the second half and United played better.', u'Before the match Rooney had been vocal in his support for Van Gaal and other senior players, including Phil Jones and Michael Carrick, had reinforced the message. But the display against Stoke was as slipshod as it had been in the 2-1 home defeat by Norwich City, suggesting the side have lost faith in Van Gaal and he admitted: \u201cWe didn\u2019t dare to play our football.\u201d', u'But asked if he had no ideas left of how to raise his squad for Chelsea\u2019s visit, Van Gaal said: \u201cNo. But it\u2019s not so easy any more. When you lose four matches in a row, it\u2019s much more difficult than after the third match. It\u2019s like that and the pressure of the environment should increase. So it is much more difficult. There are no ways, artificial ways, to solve that.', u'\u201cWe need a victory and that\u2019s very important, but we also have to do our professional work, our preparation and of course the recovery and training sessions. We only can recover, we cannot train. We have to recover and then we play the match against Chelsea. It is very difficult to do that in just two days but we shall try.\u201d', u'Despite the poor form Van Gaal claimed his players still believe in him. \u201cUntil now, I can say yes,\u201d he said.', u'Chelsea are not without their own problems. They sacked Jos\xe9 Mourinho under a fortnight ago and are only two points above the relegation zone after Saturday\u2019s draw with Watford. But Van Gaal knows the champions will provide tough opposition. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult because we have to recover,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to start after our bus trip [home], and we have to prepare also for the game. It\u2019s very tough to do that, I\u2019m aware of that.\u201d', u'Van Gaal believes the squad is being stifled by the relentless focus on the club. \u201cI have seen that in my other jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you lose in a top team, then it is always more difficult to cope with your environment and you cannot say that in Manchester it is much more different. You see that different players cope with that pressure differently. That you can see, and that is also in other teams, so you cannot say that it is a fixed thing.', u'\u201cIt is, for every individual player, for every human being, different, how they want to cope with it, and it is not so easy.\u201d', u'As a coach , he has won domestic championships at each of his four previous clubs \u2013 AZ Alkmaar, Ajax, Barcelina and Bayern Munich. Despite the dire recent results he denied his oft-mentioned \u201cphilosophy\u201d is not working at United.', u'\u201cThere has been progression,\u201d he said. \u201cA month ago we were first in the Premier League, maybe you remember that? But we lost important games and now we have to come back, in more difficult situations than last season. We were there and we have fallen back. And that\u2019s different. Everybody is judging differently, and that is what\u2019s happening now, and you have to cope with it.\u201d']

His players, meanwhile, are seeing their reputations disintegrate before their eyes, a group now so disparate and wretched that, deep down, they know only a change of coach can possibly save them.', u'Monday evening\u2019s game already feels like the occasion of Van Gaal\u2019s execution and he has now fallen so low that he has only our pity. Sympathy for the Red Devil. How embarrassing.', u'Nothing he has tried has worked, his faith in his own methods now as diminished as that he has in his players.', u'Those who saw him in the hour that followed Saturday\u2019s defeat at Stoke City were astonished by his demeanour. All fight extinguished, nothing behind the eyes, all hope gone.', u'\u2018It was hard not to feel sorry for him,\u2019 said one observer. \u2018You almost felt like encouraging him, trying to pick him up off the floor. But there was nothing there. There was no attempt to put a brave face on, no bravado. He just looked beaten. It was shocking.\u2019', u'In theory at least, there is one more chance left for Van Gaal at Old Trafford, one more sequence of events that could prolong his time at a club where nobody has any real desire at all to sack him.', u'It is this: beat Chelsea, squeeze past a troubled Swansea at home on Saturday, then beat Sheffield United of League One in the FA Cup.', u"Marko Arnautovic piled misery on Manchester United by scoring in Stoke's 2-0 win over the Red Devils", u"Van Gaal's fellow countryman Guus Hiddink (left) could be the man to put him out of his misery", u'0 United have not beaten Chelsea in any competition since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement, a run of eight matches dating back to a 3-2 win on October 2012.\xa0', u'5 There have been five red cards in the last six Premier League meetings between these two sides \u2013 three to Chelsea, two to United.\xa0', u'3 Guus Hiddink has won his last three competitive meetings with Louis van Gaal; all with PSV against AZ Alkmaar in Holland in 2005-06.\xa0', u'Maybe it\u2019s possible. Maybe one big result would trigger a sequence.', u'Staggeringly, though, this is not how Van Gaal himself sees it. One of Europe\u2019s great modern coaches, it is understood that he is resigned already to the decline in which he has allowed his players to fall this season.\xa0He hinted at that during another deeply uncomfortable press conference after Saturday\u2019s game and, privately, he has been even more explicit, even more damning.', u'Van Gaal is a man who knows his race is run, who has accepted that performances will not get better. If his players are to save him, they will have to do it on their own and, despite the words of Michael Carrick on Saturday evening, the previous 90 minutes had offered no indication it is about to happen.', u'\u2018We\u2019ve just got to try to turn it round on Monday,\u2019 said Carrick.', u'A wave goodbye? Van Gaal has hinted he could quit his managerial role at Manchester United', u"Van Gaal stayed glued to his seat in United's dugout despite his side failing to impress against Stoke", u'\u2018It is a horrible run and it is a horrible feeling.

Listen, people talk about support (for the manager) but it is not like the lads go out and don\u2019t play for him.', u'\u2018We go out there as professionals who are playing for this special club. It comes from within as well.', u'\u2018For me, I look at myself at what I can do better as an individual.

That is not who we are.\u2019', u'Carrick is an honest individual and should not be criticised for fronting up. There was not a lack of effort from United\u2019s players at the Britannia Stadium but there was a lack of application and standards of performances at United are lower than they have been for many years.', u'The alternative theory to the one that says Carrick and his team-mates aren\u2019t trying for their manager is that they just aren\u2019t good enough.', u'Manchester United vice-captain Michael Carrick has jumped to the defence of his under-fire manager', u'Carrick insists his players are still playing for Van Gaal despite their disastrous run of form', u'Interestingly, the United team sheet was viewed with some enthusiasm by Stoke manager Mark Hughes and his staff with one individual asking, quite reasonably: \u2018How many of those players would we want in our team today?\u2019 Of all the conversations that took place before and after this game, that was perhaps the most telling and the one that was subsequently proved most pertinent.', u'Van Gaal was right when he said United looked scared and he was right when he told people later that his team only started playing when they were 2-0 down.', u'Stoke were superb, of course. They have the players to hurt people these days. United, though, will never be more compliant.

It is more expensive than dismissing Louis van Gaal, or even appointing Jose Mourinho, and it may not progress beyond the discussion stage \u2014 but that doesn't mean it is not worth a try. They could put in a bid for Harry Kane.", u"It would have to be a big bid, obviously. In excess of what United paid for Anthony Martial, not quite as extraordinary as Real Madrid's offer for Gareth Bale. Yet it has to be substantial enough for Tottenham to be drawn into conversation.", u"Then United have a foot in the door. And that may be as far as they get; it certainly should be, given Tottenham's present circumstances. But this January, United must at least attempt to trigger a dialogue.", u'Signing Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur could be one way to stop the slide at Manchester United', u'Louis van Gaal is under increasing pressure with United having slumped to four consecutive defeats', u"The club have a problem, and Kane is one of the few who can fix it. He scores goals; United need goals. Equally, the club need a goalscoring hero. United's culture demands it; at least it demands a quest.", u"Van Gaal could leave, Mourinho could come in \u2014 frankly, it doesn't matter. If United cannot find a way to score, they go nowhere.", u'The rest is up to Tottenham. They are fourth in the league, six points from top, with the best chance of a Champions League finish \u2014 or even a title challenge \u2014 in years. Selling Kane would undermine that completely. It could even cause a fissure in the club, certainly with coach Mauricio Pochettino.', u"Yet Tottenham's history suggests nothing can be ruled out.", u"Not long ago, a leading Premier League executive was discussing Chelsea's doomed attempt to prise John Stones from Everton. It wasn't just the astronomical fee that was interesting, he said, but the way Everton played their hand. They wouldn't set a price. Just said no, repeatedly.", u'Chelsea started at \xa330million and kept going up. They broke one of the first rules of business negotiation: never bid against yourself. Each time Everton said no, Chelsea would return to the table with an improved offer. Each time it was rejected, Chelsea would ask Everton what they wanted. Everton said no to that, too.', u'Signing Kane could be more expensive than getting Jose Mourinho, but will the manager provide goals?', u"The fee to sign Kane would not have to be as extraordinary as Real Madrid's offer for Gareth Bale", u'West Bromwich Albion took the same approach with Saido Berahino and Tottenham. And Tottenham would with Kane, too?', u"'No,' said the executive. 'Not Tottenham. Daniel Levy will always give a price.'", u"Now that may not be entirely true. There didn't seem to be an amount that could have got Luka Modric out from White Hart Lane when Chelsea wanted him in 2011, but he did sign for Real Madrid for \xa330m in 2012.", u"From Bale through Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Carrick, Tottenham's history suggests a high price is sought \u2014 but a price nonetheless.", u"Does Tottenham's league position, and the potential in Pochettino's young squad, alter this strategy? Might Levy be as excited by Tottenham's prospects if this team stay together as the rest of us?", u"Tottenham's history suggests that chairman Daniel Levy (right) would accept a deal for the right price", u'Kane scored twice for Tottenham on Boxing Day as they beat Norwich City at White Hart Lane', u'This is a huge transfer window for a number of high-achieving Premier League clubs. Leicester City, Watford, Everton and Crystal Palace, too. Do they back their players to finish what they have started, or do they cash out?', u"If Leicester are serious about winning the title \u2014 and they should be \u2014 they must see off any speculation surrounding key players before it begins. They should issue a statement saying that no first-team members will leave the club in January, that this position is not a negotiating tactic and is immutable. They should make this clear to the players' agents, too.", u'Financially, with the new TV deal, Leicester have the clout to resist \u2014 and what player would be mad or selfish enough to destabilise them from within now?', u'Those that have taken Leicester to the top would not be forgiven by locals or neutrals if they spoiled this narrative for the sake of personal gain.', u'With the new TV deal, clubs like Tottenham have the power to resist offers for their best players now', u'Tottenham could do the same, of course. Make it plain that Kane, Dele Alli, Eric Dier or any of the group that have advanced them to fourth, and rising, will remain no matter the money on offer.', u"Yet is that Tottenham's style; or if United came calling with an offer of \xa350m plus would this give pause for thought, the way the same figure from Chelsea was enough to prise Fernando Torres out of Liverpool in 2011?", u"Kane has the ability to solve problems at Manchester United, have no doubt of that. While Van Gaal's team cannot score goals they will always be vulnerable. The injuries and suspensions that have left holes in Van Gaal's defensive shield would not be as significant if United did not find it so hard to score.", u"Norwich got two at Old Trafford on December 19, but even that would not have mattered under normal circumstances. United have won their last three home matches against them 4-0 and haven't failed to strike at least twice against Norwich at home since December 1994.", u"Van Gaal's side are not scoring enough goals, with captain Wayne Rooney unable to contribute recently", u"West Ham didn't score at Old Trafford but still came away with a point because Manchester United had failed to find the net against them for the first time in the league, home or away, since May 2007.", u"And Saturday was Manchester United's first blank against Stoke since March 2, 1983. So this is about goals. Once Stoke went 2-0 up, United had no way of winning the game.", u'Manchester United last scored three goals in a match on October 17, a run of 14 fixtures. In the Ferguson era, one has to add up a spell of 16 matches between a 4-2 win at Everton on April 28, 2007, and a 4-0 win over Wigan on October 6 to find the last time United went on an equivalent run of low scoring. And they did win eight and draw four of the 16 in that time.', u'Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward (left) may feel he has more pressing matters on his hands', u"By contrast, Van Gaal has now won three in 14 since the goals dried up. He needs a striker of Kane's calibre, desperately. Tottenham would be mad to let it happen, but United would be equally deranged not to try.", u"Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, may feel he has more pressing matters with the future of the manager to decide \u2014 but he doesn't, not really.", u'Without a finisher it is of no consequence who manages Manchester United. There is not a coach alive who can win with nil.', u'WTF, YOU NEED A KICKSTART!', u'The governing body of Taekwondo, known as the World Taekwondo Federation, is planning a rebranding.', u'Since the advent of text-speak, the acronym WTF has developed a new, and unfortunate, meaning and secretary general Hoss Rafaty \u2014 already hampered by the fact his name sounds like a Spoonerism \u2014 was no doubt fed up with being introduced to gales of laughter at meetings of athletic federation chiefs.', u'Oh yes, when it is launched The World Association of Taekwondo Sports will carry considerably more gravitas.', u"The World Taekwondo Federation will look to a rebrand after the rise of the internet acronym 'WTF'", '', u"Roll up for darts' great sideshow", u'Love the darts is the slogan \u2014 but how many people do? They love a drink, we know that. They love dressing up, too. But the darts? The actual darts?', u"At the World Darts Championship, it is sometimes easier to hit 180 than it is to see a face in the crowd who is genuinely paying attention to what is happening on stage. It's a brilliant event, but a brilliant sports event? Difficult to say.", u"I know a young man who is going there on Monday night. He and his 11 mates are venturing out as a complete Rod Stewart calendar, January to December. It sounds fun; but it's nothing to do with darts.", u'Gary Anderson is one of the stars of the World Darts Championship - but do fans care about the sport?', u"I've seen him watch plenty of sport over Christmas \u2014 football, cricket, basketball, a rugby league season review. But not one minute of darts. So he's not a fan, let alone a fanatic. He wouldn't know Adrian Lewis from Adrian Mole.", u'Yet that is the triumph of darts. What goes on at the Alexandra Palace occurs almost independently of the sport \u2014 and great credit should go to the Professional Darts Corporation for that.', u"Somehow, they have created a daily occasion, played out in an excellent feelgood atmosphere and inspired by the grand British traditions of heavy drinking and boisterous silliness, that has kept the darts in sport's mainstream.", u'Some sports that take themselves very seriously indeed would kill for the audience reach of darts.', u'A fan dressed as Superman holds a pint during play - but the attention of some is not always on the stage', u'Acting the goat, however, is not the same as engaging emotionally with a sport.', u'A lot of people say they enjoy cricket, when what they really like is dressing as Papa Smurf and getting plastered on the Saturday of a Test match.', u"Cricket's issue is that if everybody who enjoyed being a Smurf for a day actually loved the sport \u2014 the way football fans love their team, for instance \u2014 county matches wouldn't be watched by four pigeons and your grandad.", u"Darts must hope the thrill of 10 pints of Singha and a Teletubbies costume never grows old, because if it does all they've got then is some big old blokes throwing tiny arrows at a circular board and, as skilful as that might be, it really isn't the same.", u'Two men dressed as Ronald McDonald and two in Santa outfits enjoy the occasion at Alexandra Palace', '', '', u"And while we're at it...", u"Having failed to factor in Florida's hurricane season when planning England's pre-World Cup friendly matches in 2014, it now appears the Football Association have been surprised by Article 21.05 of the regulations of the UEFA Football Championship, 2014-16.", u'This stipulates that teams are allowed to play only one other qualified nation in the month preceding the finals.', u'England had lined up preparation games against the Czech Republic and Portugal, and also had Hungary or Austria in their thoughts for a third fixture. Another unfortunate development for the self-styled best prepared team at every tournament.', u"England's preparations in 2014 were interrupted by the weather in Florida, and there are new issues now", '', u'HOWE WAS A REAL DEFENSIVE KINGPIN\xa0\xa0', u"Don Howe wasn't without his blind spots. He regarded No 10 as the nothing role, even when played by maestros such as Michel Platini or Glenn Hoddle.", u"But he knew football and he particularly knew defensive strategy, and one look at England's World Cup performances during his time as coach confirms that thoroughness. Over three tournaments between 1982 and 1990, England played 16 matches at World Cup finals \u2014 not including the meaningless third-place play-off against Italy \u2014 and let in just eight goals.", u'Don Howe\xa0knew football and he particularly knew defensive strategy, as seen with his work with England', u'The opponents were no fools in that time, either: West Germany (twice), Spain, France, Czechoslovakia, Argentina, Poland, Portugal, Paraguay, Holland, Belgium, Cameroon and the Republic of Ireland were 13 of them.', u'When Howe returned under Terry Venables for the European Championship in 1996, he kept it equally tight \u2014 just three goals conceded in five matches against Germany, Spain, Holland, Scotland and Switzerland.', u"Venables was a smart coach. As well as utilising Howe's technical expertise, his physical demeanour \u2014 a 60-year-old man, bald head, cloth cap, glasses \u2014 made Venables look younger, and therefore more approachable to the players.", u"Venables would occasionally interrupt one of Howe's meticulous exercises to suggest a livelier, more enjoyable drill. Howe knew the game and played along.", u"Terry\xa0Venables  utilised Howe's technical expertise and his physical demeanour  made him look younger", u'At other times, he was happy to be the bad cop, allowing Venables to keep his positive relationship with the group.', u"Gary Neville recalls that after one match, using a young defence, Venables was praising the players when Howe cut in. 'You may be happy, but I'm not,' he snapped. 'We conceded a goal from a set-piece and that's ridiculous. We worked on that in training.'", u'Quite probably, Venables felt the same \u2014 but he knew any criticism would sound less hurtful and dispiriting to rookies if coming from a coach, not the manager.', u'On the day Howe died, Neville described working with him as an education. Looking at the standard of defending in the Premier League most weeks, there are more than a few who still need his lessons.', '', u'Gary\xa0Neville described working with Howe as an education, and one that could help the Premier League', u'What a fool Jose Mourinho was to tell Diego Costa to spend his time over by the corner flag, and on the fringes of the penalty area, instead of in a prime position to score goals.', u'Suddenly, against Watford, he occupied the central role and scored twice for the first time since January 17. Guus Hiddink must be quite perplexed that so many easy fixes were ignored by his predecessor.', u'(Raises single eyebrow in arch manner.)', u'Diego Costa scored twice for Chelsea against Watford after struggling for much of the season so far', u'Manchester City did all they could to protect Manuel Pellegrini from speculation. They gave him a new deal, for a year beyond the end of this season, precisely to ward off damaging headlines, whispers and rumours, and keep the dressing room stable.', u"Pep Guardiola, as good as serving notice on Bayern Munich, put an end to that. Pellegrini says his players will be impervious to the resulting uncertainty \u2014 but that isn't true.", u"Indeed, considering City's motives for negotiating last summer, one might say he has the contract to prove it.", u"Manchester City's link with Pep Guardiola could affect their players as speculation looms about him", u'Manuel Pellegrini (right) was meant to be protected from the speculation but the talk is intensifying', '', '', u'\n                                \tShare what you think\n                                ', u'The comments below have been moderated in advance.', u'\n                        The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n                    ', u'By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.', u'Copy link to paste in your message', u'Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd', u'Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group']

Is this the sign that the story which has been so captivating is coming to an end? Has the magnitude of leading the field suddenly become inhibiting? Ranieri hopes not. Another big test against Manchester City beckons and he wants to see the enjoyment return.', u'He has never entertained talk that Leicester are title challengers, nor has Ranieri made bold predictions about what they will achieve. What he does expect, however, is his squad to attack the second half of the campaign with gusto. Why should they do anything else?', u"'City is another fantastic test,' said Ranieri.

I want to see my players enjoy, why were we so nervous at the beginning today?", u"'Just play football. Enjoy (the position) and enjoy playing football.

Manuel Pellegrini's side may have swatted Sunderland away on Boxing Day but they have travelled poorly in recent months and Vardy and Mahrez have the tools to expose the gaps left by Vincent Kompany's absence.", u'It will be intriguing to see how Jamier Vardy copes, having been linked with a \xa330million move to the Etihad', u'Certainly, it will be intriguing to see how Vardy \u2014 whom Ranieri reported to be struggling with the effects of a virus \u2014 copes, having been linked with a \xa330million move to the Etihad Stadium in the January window. It is the type of occasion he and his colleagues should relish.', u"'I want to achieve the next three points,' said Ranieri, who substituted Vardy and Mahrez at Anfield to preserve their fitness. 'I want to speak to my players and understand what they think about the team, what we can achieve, and after that I speak about what is my idea about this season.\xa0", u"'It is the same.

"In a way it made it worse because we thought \'can you imagine the European Championships with these fans?\' \n', u'    "There\'s no doubt about it the European Championships are going to be worse off without us being there."\n', u'Scotland defeated the Republic of Ireland at home and drew in Dublin', u'    Strachan, 58, also believes his team are better than many of the sides who qualified for the finals in France next summer.\n', u'    "I would say definitely, absolutely definitely," said Strachan.

Second and third in our group couldn\'t beat us.\n', u'    "We were 10 seconds away from beating Poland, and Ireland never beat us, but they produced results against Germany. \n', u'    "Wales have got (Gareth) Bale and (Aaron) Ramsey who are two world class players.

Strachan though feels it was the \n    \r\n1-0 defeat to Georgia in Tbilisi \r\n\n     that made the difference, but said he would not have done anything differently.\n', u'    "It came down to seven passes against Georgia," he said. "People say we could have played quicker - not we couldn\'t. When teams play everyone behind the ball you have to take your time, because you can not move the ball quickly if they do not come at you quickly, it\'s impossible to do that.\n', u'    "For anyone to say otherwise is nonsense.

guardian [u'\nBen Fisher at the Vitality Stadium', u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 17.30\xa0EST\n\n', u'Alan Pardew has called on Wilfried Zaha to rediscover his unpredictability and killer instinct after losing Yannick Bolasie to a hip injury that could sideline the Crystal Palace winger for up to two months.', u'Bolasie missed their entertaining goalless draw at Bournemouth on Saturday following a scan on a hip joint. Palace were blunt and feeble when it mattered with Fraizer Campbell, making only his second league start of the season, going closest for the Eagles.', u'\u201cWe have to wait and see, sometimes they react well. He\u2019s had a scan but we do not know how long, but it could be four weeks, it could be eight,\u201d said Pardew of losing Bolasie, after his side extended their unbeaten Premier League run to five matches.', u'Palace struggled to counterattack with any meaningful intent without the winger, while the strikers Connor Wickham and Patrick Bamford also missed the trip through injury. Though the visitors sorely missed the spark of Bolasie \u2013 who was instrumental in away wins at Liverpool, Chelsea and Stoke City \u2013 the Palace manager is confident Zaha can inject the required life into their challenge to qualify for European football next season.', u'\u201cIt gives other guys a chance,\u201d said Pardew, urging Zaha to make his presence felt on Monday against Swansea. \u201cI will never take away his exuberance, his will to take people on, I encourage that. But he was a little predictable in his movements, he needs to bounce off the line and ask questions of the full-back. He\u2019s had a great season for us but with Yala [Bolasie] lost he becomes even more important.\u201d', u'Palace contained their former striker Glenn Murray with ease, restricting the room for manoeuvre of a striker who scored 44 goals while at Selhurst Park. Murray squandered Bournemouth\u2019s best chance, too, his tame second-half shot failing to trouble the Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey.', u'Bournemouth \u2013 another of the Premier League\u2019s form sides \u2013 gave as good as they got, their midfield contesting every loose ball. They have spent money to compete, though, and will face a financial sanction from the Football League after it was announced on Thursday that they had breached financial fair play regulations, thus gaining an unfair advantage in their promotion season from the Championship. The Cherries essentially overspent according to the existing FFP structure, exceeding the \xa36m maximum deviation allowed to reach the top flight for the first time in their history.', u'\u201cIt is no surprise to us because we knew where we were from the situation,\u201d said the manager, Eddie Howe. \u201cWe have got an ambitious owner, we\u2019ve an ambitious club that want to move forward and to do that, I\u2019m sorry, at this level and Championship level, our income is nowhere near enough to achieve success.', u'\u201cI think it is very, very difficult to achieve some success without any financial backing. Not so much in League One and League Two because we achieved promotion with a year-long embargo so it is possible up to a certain point and then you do need to invest.', u'\u201cWhat the FFP structure will do is stop the underdog, the smaller team having the chance to succeed and I do not think anyone will want to see that \u2013 the rich get richer and the smaller clubs struggle to compete.\u201d', u'Next up for Howe\u2019s team is a first trip to the Emirates Stadium where they will face an Arsenal side who were defeated 4-0 by Bournemouth\u2019s south coast neighbours Southampton on Boxing Day evening. It will provide a stage for Howe\u2019s side to try to topple another one of the big four after beating Manchester United and Chelsea already this season.', u'In recent years the Christmas period had thrown up matches against Yeovil and Cheltenham and Bournemouth\u2019s former Tottenham defender Adam Smith is looking forward to a familiar battle, having spent six years on the books at White Hart Lane.', u'\u201cI am a former Spurs boy so it will be nice for me and my family to play at the Emirates,\u201d he said. \u201cAll my family are Spurs fans so they are all coming to support me so hopefully it will be a good result for us.\u201d', u'Man of the match Damien Delaney (Crystal Palace)']

Villa are nine points behind the Canaries, a place above the relegation zone, going into Monday\u2019s game at Carrow Road.', u'Garde\u2019s side are bottom of the Premier League and also four points adrift of Sunderland, who they play on Saturday. They are winless in 17 games since the opening day of the season and after Boxing Day\u2019s 1-1 draw with West Ham, Garde knows their next two games are crucial.', u'\u201cI think we definitely have to win one of these two,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be difficult because we are fighting against teams not in a good position too.', u'\u201c I would like to add the spirit within the dressing room, it is much better now. The energy in the group is much better than a few weeks earlier. It will probably help us to have this kind of performance more regularly.\u201d', u'Jordan Ayew\u2019s penalty rescued a point in Saturday\u2019s draw with the Hammers but Rudy Gestede, who started ahead of Scott Sinclair, wasted two fine chances and faces a battle to keep his place at Carrow Road.', u'\u201cFootball is about creating chances and converting chances,\u201d said Garde. \u201cRudy is not lucky at the moment but he worked very hard for the team. Sometimes he had chances but I won\u2019t blame him \u2013 I won\u2019t blame anyone. We gave everything in terms of individuals and the collective.\u201d', u'After scoring his fifth club goal of the season, Ayew believes Villa\u2019s form will turn despite their desperate plight. \u201cWe have to continue like this, things are changing bit by bit,\u201d he told AVTV. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win games if we continue playing like this, there\u2019s no doubt.\u201d', u'West Ham\u2019s concerns are centred on an injury list that is threatening to derail their season.', u'James Tomkins (head) and Aaron Cresswell (hamstring) were forced off at Villa Park but the club hope they will be fit to face Southampton with Andy Carroll and Nikica Jelavic joining Dimitri Payet, Victor Moses and Manuel Lanzini in struggling with injury.', u'\u201cI\u2019m the first one to say we have a good squad but we miss the players we\u2019ve got,\u201d their captain, Mark Noble, said. \u201cWe miss the players who create stuff and score goals. Take away Jelavic, Carroll, Dimitri, Lanzini and Moses, it\u2019s going to hurt any squad.', u'\u201cWe have come through a tough spell with a lot of games with a squad which is depleted but the boys have dug in well and I\u2019m proud of them.\u201d']

guardian [u'\nRichard Jolly at the Etihad Stadium', u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 17.30\xa0EST\n\n', u'The positions of Manuel Pellegrini and Sam Allardyce could not have been more contrasting as they stood in the same corridor here on Saturday. An emphatic scoreline in Manchester City\u2019s favour had left them with the Premier League\u2019s most potent attack and Sunderland with its most porous defence. However, the managers did have one thing in common \u2013 they both endured spells each lasting nine minutes that proved extremely damaging.', u'\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d said the Sunderland manager, reflecting on the first-half period in which his side conceded three goals. For City, it was the short time of Vincent Kompany\u2019s comeback. The captain was brought on in the 62nd minute but limped off in the 71st, his calf again proving too fragile.', u'\u201cWe were worried,\u201d said Pellegrini, who hoped he was easing the centre-back into the rhythm of first-team football. If the plan had been to restore Kompany to the starting 11 for Tuesday\u2019s top-of-the-table clash at Leicester, it proved ill-conceived and the player now faces a third spell on the sidelines this season.', u'City await the results of a scan on Kompany\u2019s calf, knowing two previous such injuries have kept the Belgium defender out for around six weeks each. A repeat would probably mean him missing, among other things, two Premier League games against Leicester and both legs of the Capital One Cup semi-final against Everton. City argue they have prepared for such eventualities, but the figures show Kompany\u2019s injuries have considerable consequences.', u'\u201cIf you review how many games we played over the last two seasons, Vincent plays a maximum 70% of the season,\u201d said Pellegrini.', u'The Belgian has only started 37% of City\u2019s fixtures in the current campaign, a percentage that is set to decrease. The bigger numbers concern the cost of the alternatives. City have invested \xa374m in Eliaquim Mangala and Nicol\xe1s Otamendi, making them the two most expensive centre-backs in Premier League history, but neither has proved an adequate replacement for Kompany.', u'\u201cHe\u2019s very important because first of all he is captain,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cHe is captain because he has a lot of important things to give: his performance, his personality.\u201d And, this season, his reliability. The most irrelevant goal of Saturday\u2019s game, as Fabio Borini reduced the deficit, nevertheless had a statistical significance: Kompany has not started 17 matches this season and City have not kept a clean sheet in any of them. \u201cWe cannot think that all the mistakes are just because Vincent isn\u2019t playing,\u201d said Pellegrini.', u'\u201cWe must try to continue being competitive. That depends on the performances of Mangala, Otamendi and [Martin] Demichelis. It is an important challenge for other players.\u201d', u'Kevin De Bruyne, a team-mate for club and country, knows Kompany better than most. \u201cWe need to cope without him, even though it is harder,\u201d he said. The City captain and centre-back later posted a defiant message on Facebook, voicing his determination to be the world\u2019s best defender and declaring, paradoxically, that \u201cmy body feels invincible\u201d only to admit he keeps breaking down.', u'\u201cMentally it will be hard for him,\u201d said De Bruyne, who has been an ever-present since his August arrival. A goal and two assists against Sunderland means he has 10 of each in 23 games. The \xa354m outlay for him was huge, but seems justified. \u201cPeople talk about it, but I don\u2019t care how much money City spend,\u201d said the winger.', u'His virtuosity, and a match with five goals, a missed penalty and a series of spurned chances, served to illustrate the importance of high-class defenders. Allardyce is embarking on a January search for one. \u201cA central defender would be the first priority,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether we can find one good enough is another matter. It will probably have to be abroad. It will be very difficult to secure a player from another Premier League club.\u201d And, with Sunderland five points from safety, it is a moot point if they would want to join.', u'There may be more candidates for the exit. Allardyce argued that everyone has had an opportunity. \u201cNone of them can moan about not being in the team any more,\u201d he said. \u201cI can moan about them more than they can moan about me.\u201d', u'His need for reinforcements was inadvertently underlined by Sebasti\xe1n Coates, who was hauled off after 22 minutes at Chelsea the previous week. The Uruguayan misunderstood a question about Sunderland\u2019s dismal away form, presumed it was an observation about his own displays and appeared to agree. \u201cI am always critical of myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I need to learn.\u201d His honesty did him credit, but solidity is the requirement for both managers.', u'Man of the match Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)']

guardian [u'\nJamie Jackson at the Britannia Stadium', u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 17.30\xa0EST\n\n', u'The sorry mess Manchester United have become under Louis van Gaal is summed up in there being no surprise should he be sacked or resign at any moment.', u'The beleaguered Dutchman is supposedly in charge for Monday night\u2019svisit of Chelsea. But really, who knows? Who knows when the owners, the Glazers, will tire of gazing at a table that shows United on a downward plunge that gives no sign of stopping and decide to sack the club\u2019s 22nd manager?', u'Van Gaal, too, may come to the same conclusion. That he has lost his way, lost the side in a morass of odd selections, playing style and public utterances, and that it is best for all that the honourable thing is done and he walks.', u'When a manager continues to find a new low for his team, alarms should sound. United were near-pathetic in the 2-1 defeat to Norwich City. Against Stoke City there were no doubts: they were pathetic. Particularly during a first half when both goals from Mark Hughes\u2019s side occurred following amateurish mistakes from United players.', u'Bojan Krkic\u2019s 19th-minute opener came via Memphis Depay\u2019s insipid headed backpass. It failed to reach David de Gea, Glen Johnson capitalised and found Krkic, who finished. Next to commit a calamitous error was Ashley Young. He is a stand-in right-back and as with his costly slip-ups against Norwich, he showed why. This time he committed a needless handball, Krkic\u2019s subsequent free-kick hit the wall, and Marko Arnautovic rifled home a 25-yard peach of a goal.', u'Cut to Van Gaal on the bench, whose perma-impassive expression casts him as an impotent manager whose ideas have expired. Body-language enthusiasts may enjoy studying the United bench. Van Gaal usually sits with Ryan Giggs to his left and Albert Stuivenberg to his right. Giggs is the nominal No2, Van Gaal\u2019s supposed right-hand man. Stuivenberg, his compatriot, is an assistant coach. Yet there can be zero communication between any of them, and after United conceded Van Gaal maintained the rigid posture of a man in no mood to discuss how the side could be rescued.', u' Related: Louis van Gaal says \u2018I can quit by myself\u2019 and will speak to Ed Woodward ', u'As a bona fide club legend Giggs will detest the results \u2013 this was a fourth loss in a row \u2013 and surely the manner of them. Yet nothing is ever heard from the Welshman and little seen of him during a game. It was the same story here. The chilling Van Gaal factor seems to affect staff as well as players.', u'One demand of the high-end footballer is to support his manager. Publicly, at least. Michael Carrick began the day as captain for the dropped Wayne Rooney and ended it having to offer the latest platitudes about Van Gaal.', u'He said: \u201cListen, people talk about support but it is not like the lads go out and don\u2019t play. We go out there as professionals who are playing for this special club. We are in a privileged position. And it comes from within as well. I look at myself, at what I can do better as an individual. I have a lot of pride in myself and in my performances and I think it is a bit disrespectful when people say that the lads aren\u2019t trying for the manager.', u'\u201cThat hurts us a lot because that is not the type of people we are. We haven\u2019t won games and it is fair enough if people criticise things that have gone wrong on the pitch. But to say we are not trying for certain people is quite disrespectful and it hurts us a lot.', u'\u201cWe\u2019re playing for this great club. As I say, it is a special club. It is pride in yourself, pride in the club and pride in everyone \u2013 your team-mates and staff. Everyone\u2019s involved. We are all in it together and none of us can hide from that.\u201d', u'The actions yelling a lot louder than these words are in displays that have resulted in seven matches with no win and the two months that have passed since United last scored two goals from open play without the help of the opposition. Since Everton were beaten 3-0 at Goodison Park on 17 October only own goals and penalties have allowed Van Gaal\u2019s side to register more than once.', u'There are any number of similarly damning statistics, and the one that materially matters is the number of victories. There have been three in the past 14 outings. The next chance to halt the rot comes when Guus Hiddink\u2019s Chelsea side visit on Monday evening.', u'Carrick said: \u201cIn some ways it is ideal but whoever it is next we just need a win. Irrespective of who we are playing, we need a win.', u'\u201cThat\u2019s the next game so we will be up for that, we will be positive for that. And we have to win. That\u2019s what we are here for. We\u2019ve got to step up and be ready for Monday.\u201d', u'It is all sounding a little forlorn. As Hughes, a former United striker, said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t allow them to settle \u2013 any anxiety they had or apprehension about the game was borne out because in that opening period we were really dominant.\u201d', u'The last time United dominated any opposition seems an age ago.

guardian [u"\nLouise Taylor at St James' Park", u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 17.30\xa0EST\n\n', u'Tom Cleverley harboured mixed emotions. If heading Everton\u2019s winner seconds before the final whistle had clearly left the midfielder on a high, it was tempered by a swift glance at the Premier League table.', u'Roberto Mart\xednez\u2019s side stand ninth, six points short of fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur, and Cleverley is not alone in believing they should be doing considerably better. \u201cWe definitely feel we should be in that top four,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel we\u2019ve got the squad to be challenging up there.\u201d', u'Few present at a sodden St James\u2019 Park would disagree. Everton dominated first-half possession, embarrassing Newcastle by running through an appealing repertoire of one- and two-touch passing accompanied by seamless positional rotation. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re playing top-six football without the results,\u201d said Cleverley. \u201cIt\u2019s so enjoyable to play in this team. The [positional] rotation, the short passing, the combinations, it\u2019s really exciting. I\u2019m really enjoying my football again.\u201d', u'Everton possess one of the league\u2019s most feared strikers in Romelu Lukaku, and, arguably, its most exciting winger in Gerard Deulofeu (who, having finally stepped off the bench, helped win the corner and then delivered it to preface Cleverley\u2019s clincher). Yet despite this they often struggle to finish opponents off and a record of six wins and eight draws in 18 games has damaged their chances of European qualification via the league.', u' Related: Romelu Lukaku revels in emergence as Everton\u2019s striking talisman ', u'By the second half a Newcastle side playing very much on the break had identified a key reason why.', u'For all Everton\u2019s comfort in possession while building from the back and as pleasing as John Stones\u2019s distribution from centre-half invariably is, Mart\xednez\u2019s side are not that great in the air.', u'Consequently a team which forced Tim Howard into only one save \u2013 from Georginio Wijnaldum\u2019s header \u2013 also missed possibly the evening\u2019s two most clear-cut chances when Aleksandar Mitrovic connected with a couple of stellar crosses but somehow headed both wide.', u'Granted, Rob Elliot, Newcastle\u2019s excellent goalkeeper, made a series of tremendous saves, most notably from Lukaku, but even Mart\xednez had surely settled for a draw when, deep in stoppage time, Elliot could only punch Deulofeu\u2019s corner to Cleverley. Unmarked, he rose to squeeze a looping header just under the bar.', u'\u201cHopefully this can be the turning point in our season,\u201d said the former Manchester United midfielder. \u201cHopefully winning at Newcastle will be our catapult to be really challenging in that top six.\u201d', u'Stoke, Everton\u2019s Goodison Park guests on Monday, will arrive with no intention of buying into that particular narrative and Mart\xednez is certainly not underestimating the immediate challenge.', u'\u201cIf Stoke had started the season a bit sharper they could be in the top four now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have incredible balance. Mark Hughes has done a remarkable job to introduce flair and creativity without losing all the good things his team already had. We\u2019ll have to be ready.\u201d', u'To slightly differing extents Mart\xednez, Hughes and Steve McClaren share a broad vision of their teams playing an attractive, attacking passing game underpinned by controlled possession. Unfortunately for McClaren, a lack of suitable personnel dictates that he has had to scrap his original blueprint for a much more pragmatic model he hopes will serve as a temporary fix, enabling Newcastle to escape relegation.', u'The former England manager could be forgiven for casting covetous eyes at Everton\u2019s Gareth Barry \u2013 how Newcastle could do with an experienced, slick-passing central midfielder possessing an adhesive touch \u2013 but, without such a figure, he must find a way to lift his team out of the bottom three by outwitting Tony Pulis at The Hawthorns on Monday. Perhaps switching Moussa Sissoko from wide right to central midfield might prove a worthwhile experiment.', u'\u201cWest Brom\u2019s a mental test as much as a physical test for us,\u201d said McClaren. \u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge.\u201d', u'He has reasons to be cautiously optimistic that Newcastle might just rise to it. Although Fabricio Coloccini was lucky not to concede a first-half penalty for fouling Lukaku and Daryl Janmaat might have been sent off for a second bookable offence, their second-half performance came steeped in admirable spirit.', u'With Chancel Mbemba, a fast-improving young centre-half, starting to get Lukaku\u2019s measure Newcastle no longer sat quite so deep and, beginning to press Everton higher up the pitch, looked worth a point. \u201cIf we carry on like this we\u2019ll start winning games,\u201d said McClaren. \u201cHopefully 2016 will be better for us.\u201d', u'Man of the match Rob Elliot (Newcastle United)']

guardian [u'\u2022 \u2018We need striker for the other option, to work for the other minutes\u2019\u2022 Claudio Ranieri urges Leicester to forget loss before Manchester City game', u'\nAndy Hunter at Anfield', u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 17.30\xa0EST\n\n', u'It was all about reactions at Anfield. Christian Benteke produced one to leave Claudio Ranieri needing one while J\xfcrgen Klopp\u2019s message to the match-winner and the first defence to nullify Leicester City since May underlined the standards he expects consistently from Liverpool. The responses could shape the course of both clubs\u2019 seasons.', u'Benteke brought Liverpool a thoroughly deserved, hard-earned first win in five matches after being summoned from the bench to replace Divock Origi, the 20-year-old who was preferred to the \xa332.5m striker against the Premier League leaders before joining the growing band of Anfield players with a hamstring problem. Klopp\u2019s team controlled possession and closed Leicester\u2019s escape routes from the start, albeit without seriously testing Kasper Schmeichel, to leave Ranieri lamenting a visiting display that was threatening only after Benteke\u2019s sixth goal in Liverpool colours.', u'The Belgium international squandered an easier chance in stoppage time than the half-volley he converted from Roberto Firmino\u2019s inviting cross, shooting straight at Wes Morgan when allowed to run clear on an open goal despite being offside. But the finish that mattered was the reaction Klopp needed from Benteke following talks after the 3-0 reverse at Watford. Now he wants more, and not only in front of goal.', u'\u201cThere is no doubt he brings goals,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cWe need his goals but I don\u2019t only think about him and goals. We are not a team that can play with a striker who scores a goal but is not involved in the game for the other 89 minutes. We need the striker for the other options too, to work for the other minutes. I know Christian can do this, that\u2019s what I said. We had a really good talk in the week. He knows what he has to do. He came in and had a really good game, and decided the game. So well done!\u201d', u'Benteke\u2019s all-round contribution will assume greater importance to Liverpool should Origi be sidelined for an extended period. Daniel Sturridge took to Twitter moments after the final whistle to declare himself fit and available but Klopp made it clear he will be the judge of that. \u201cThis is absolutely the same thing that Daniel said four weeks ago, and we let him play and he was injured again,\u201d said Klopp of the striker he has put on a pre-season training routine that has a week to go.', u'\u201cHe says this, you ask him, and he says he\u2019s good. I know he is good, but he has to train. Otherwise we always have this situation for the next 10 years and always talk about \u2018where is Daniel Sturridge \u2013 can you play him?\u2019. We have to try and change something, we have tried everything else, so we must try this now.\u201d', u'Klopp\u2019s injury problems continued with Martin Skrtel\u2019s hamstring strain last week but, in Skrtel\u2019s absence, Dejan Lovren returned ahead of schedule from a knee problem, was shifted to the right of central defence alongside Mamadou Sakho and produced a commanding display to repel Leicester\u2019s late rally. Another benchmark set in his manager\u2019s eyes.', u'\u201cIt was not easy for the two of them coming straight back in after injuries but they did really good,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cThe one thing I did say to them was: \u2018Don\u2019t play these passes. If you want to kill me, use a knife, don\u2019t play these passes!\u2019 They both played them, it\u2019s an invitation for a counterattack. But they played good otherwise and a clean sheet is really good.\u201d', u'Leicester\u2019s reaction to their first league defeat since September, and only their second of the season, may determine how long they remain in the ascendency. Ranieri\u2019s team host Manchester City on Tuesday and their manager found light relief in Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s men being described as title rivals in the post-match press conference. Genuine relief, presumably, arrived with the result from St Mary\u2019s Stadium later.', u'\u201cYes, our rivals, or so you think!\u201d laughed the Italian. \u201cCity is another fantastic test, that is all. We are dreaming, we are in good position, 38 points, fantastic. It is our dream. I want to see my players enjoy but why were we so nervous at the beginning? I don\u2019t know. Enjoy playing football \u2013 if we lose then we lose, but we should just go out and play, and not be nervous. We have to recover but we must recover in the mind. We knew we had to lose eventually so we must forget. It is how we react mentally now.\u201d', u'Man of the match: Dejan Lovren (Liverpool)']

Although Newcastle are in the relegation zone, Steve McClaren\u2019s side will go level on points with Albion, five places above them, if they win at The Hawthorns on Monday.', u'\u201cThis league this year is as tough as it has been,\u201d said Pulis, who is expected to give the unsettled Saido Berahino his first start for two months in the Newcastle game. \u201cThere\u2019s a concertina effect with clubs that means anybody could be involved [in the relegation battle].\u201d', u'Other than a lack of goals, which has not been helped by the fallout from Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s failed attempts to sign Berahino in the summer, the main concern for Albion is poor form on their own ground. Only Aston Villa, the Premier League\u2019s bottom club, have picked up fewer points at home this season.', u'\u201cThe league\u2019s so tight,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cIf you can win a couple of games you find yourself in a real good position, but if you lose a couple you get sucked back into it. We realise that, but we\u2019re capable of winning games. We didn\u2019t really deserve to lose at Swansea and that\u2019s been the story of the last couple of matches, so hopefully we can put that right against Newcastle.\u201d', u'A sense of injustice pursued Albion at Swansea, where Pulis felt that Roger East, the referee, denied them two clear penalties. Fletcher claimed that Albion have now been on the wrong end of half a dozen spot-kick decisions this season, although the captain was honest enough to admit that Callum McManaman, whom Pulis has criticised for diving this season, did not help himself when he tumbled to the ground rather theatrically late-on.', u' Related: Garry Monk sacked by Swansea after one win in past 11 games ', u'\u201cI think Call\u2019s made the most of it and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not given,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cI think everyone can see that, he throws himself. I think sometimes with an unnatural movement you don\u2019t get it. Maybe if he tried to stay on his feet, take the hit and go down, he might get a penalty but when you throw yourself like that you\u2019re not going to get them, and that\u2019s another one of those frustrating ones.\u201d For Swansea there is finally some light at the end of a long tunnel.', u'The club are still without a manager and they desperately need a proven goalscorer but a first league win in more than two months, courtesy of Ki Sung-yueng\u2019s ninth minute tap-in, has at least bought breathing space.', u'Two away games follow, at Crystal Palace on Monday and Manchester United on Saturday, and Swansea will need to show the same sort of character and spirit that the evergreen Leon Britton epitomised against Albion if they are to get anything from those matches.', u'\u201cWe would rather be passing and pleasing on the eye, that\u2019s the ideal way to pick up three points,\u201d Britton said. \u201cBut in certain games, and certain situations, the game dictates what you have to do and West Brom was a case of digging in and grinding out a result.\u201d', u'Man of the match Leon Britton (Swansea City)']

guardian [u"\nDavid Hytner at St Mary's Stadium", u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 17.30\xa0EST\n\n', u'Ars\xe8ne Wenger had complained bitterly about the referee, Jon Moss. He had sniped at Southampton for being overly physical. And he had given short shrift to questions about new signings. Arsenal bingo players were close to completing their cards, after a surprise and frustrating defeat, and then Wenger allowed them to do so, when he revealed bad news on the injury front.', u'Jack Wilshere, the manager said, would not be back from the fractured fibula that has destroyed his season until February, at the earliest. There has long been the hope the midfielder would return in January but he is still not back in full training and his progress has been slow.', u'\u201cHe will not be back before February, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cIs there a comeback date? I say February but, honestly, I don\u2019t know. I let him do his recovery. It\u2019s going slowly. Once he goes outside to train and once he is back again into sharp, hard work, physically, you count five or six weeks. At the moment, he is not there yet.\u201d', u' Related: Arsenal\u2019s Jack Wilshere facing lengthy layoff with leg injury ', u'It was one of those days for Arsenal, a missed opportunity against opponents who had been in poor form; the kind of day their supporters had hoped was behind them but, in their hearts, knew was not and probably never will be.', u'Wenger hunted for scapegoats and the obvious one, to his mind, was Moss. Wenger insisted none of Southampton\u2019s first three goals should have stood: because of an offside in the buildup to Cuco Martina\u2019s stunning opener; a foul by Shane Long on Laurent Koscielny before the second; and an erroneously awarded corner on the third. \u201cI cannot take the whistle, [although] I would love to,\u201d Wenger said.', u'He was also unhappy with Long. \u201cWhat has he done from the first to the last minute?\u201d Wenger asked, to which the answer should have been: run the channels relentlessly, stretch Arsenal and bully Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Wenger, though, meant to highlight what he perceived as Long\u2019s overstepping of various marks.', u'Wenger had a point about Long\u2019s off-the-ball trip on Koscielny, which went undetected but his gripes about the first and third goals were more spurious, in that they did not excuse the defending from his team that followed. Mertesacker failed to get distance on his clearing header, although there was no legislating for Martina\u2019s 30-yard, outside-of-the-boot blockbuster and the marking on the corner for Jos\xe9 Fonte\u2019s goal was sloppy.', u'The reality was that Arsenal got what they deserved from an insipid and heavy-legged performance, and against a Southampton team that were inspired. With Wenger missing seven players through injury, he had named the same side for the fourth time in 17 days. Was it one game too far for them? The problem, though, is that they have another one at home to Bournemouth on Mondayand Wenger\u2019s options for freshening things up are not extensive.', u'\u201cA lot of the players have not been overloaded,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cIf you look at the number of games that Flamini, Ramsey and Campbell have played since the start of the season \u2013 even Giroud was out for a while and didn\u2019t play games, Walcott, as well. All these players are not overloaded with games.\u201d', u'Wenger is close to a permanent deal for the Basel and Egypt midfielder Mohamed Elneny \u2013 the 23-year-old is expected to sign shortly after the January transfer window opens \u2013 but the manager will generally look for internal solutions, rather like Southampton did here to such spectacular effect.', u'Martina and Long stepped in after C\xe9dric Soares and Graziano Pell\xe8 had been injured in training, and they were part of a radically hardier collective performance. Southampton had drawn one and lost five of their previous six fixtures but their tails are back up for the trip to West Ham United on Monday.', u'\u201cIt was back to basics,\u201d Long said. \u201cThere was more mentality, confidence and being positive on the pitch. We had a few meetings and the gaffer made it a bit more fun in training. He had the lads joking and you could see the results.\u201d', u'Ronald Koeman, though, was not laughing at the lack of preparation time before West Ham United. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to be recovered 100%,\u201d the Southampton manager said. \u201cThe players are at risk of serious injury. I like Boxing Day football, the stadiums full of supporters, but to play again in 43 hours, it\u2019s not normal.\u201d', u'Man of the match Shane Long (Southampton)']

guardian [u'\nPaul Doyle at White Hart Lane', u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 17.30\xa0EST\n\n', u'Of all the criticisms aimed at Louis van Gaal during his time at Old Trafford, the one about his reluctance to stand and shout from the sidelines has always seemed the most dubious. The Dutchman has explained in the past that since players can seldom hear instructions hollered from beyond the pitch, such antics are futile expressions of vanity, acts of coaches keen to show that they have an influence rather than to actually have one. But Mauricio Pochettino has arrived at a different opinion and Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s manager believes that this victory over Norwich City helped prove his point.', u'Midway through the second half, with Tottenham two goals to the good and purring, Pochettino, who spent most of the game on his feet, let out a roar. Then he gesticulated to the crowd to do likewise. The White Hart Lane faithful duly turned up the noise, helping to restore the intensity that Pochettino demands and, according to the manager, thereby helping Spurs to add a third goal.', u'\u201cThere was a moment after 15 minutes of the second half where we were playing brilliant but hadn\u2019t killed the game and we missed a pass and you only heard silence,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cSo I started to shout and try to give the players the energy to kill the game. The supporters were brilliant afterwards because we started to translate the energy from them.\u201d', u'The Argentinian has not always been quite so animated but he said that Spurs\u2019 habit of dropping points from leading positions \u2013 11 this season \u2013 persuaded him to try to conduct the atmosphere to stop his players from lapsing into vulnerability. \u201cYou always need to improve in life and football and I needed to shout,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed to shout at the stands and if I need to do it at the players too, I needed to learn that. Because at 2-0 the game may seem dead but in the Premier League it never is. When I feel from the touchline that the energy is a little bit down, I can always help the players and the people.\u201d', u'The primary force behind Spurs\u2019 victory, though, and the reason they amassed a two-goal lead in the first place and are challenging for a top-four finish and possibly even the title, was the skill of their players. Harry Kane and Dele Alli sparkled in particular, the latter yet again producing a demonstration of nimble, tough and artful midfield play that left onlookers marvelling at the fact that he is only 19. Alli created the chances that led to Kane\u2019s two first-half goals and the collusion between the pair was wonderful to watch.', u'\u201cTheir characteristics are very compatible,\u201d says Pochettino. \u201cIn the team they create very good energy between them. But I believe that it is not only them, it is the whole squad. Tom Carroll came from the bench and had a real impact and scored a great goal so the squad has very good balance.\u201d', u'Another factor that drove Spurs to overcome Norwich\u2019s initial defiance was the earlier defeat of Van Gaal\u2019s Manchester United at Stoke City, which presented Tottenham with an opportunity to consolidate their position in the top four. \u201cWe were watching the game until just after half-time \u2013 it was great,\u201d said Kane. \u201cWe knew it was a chance to get ahead of United and we did the job. We now have to do it again on Monday.\u201d', u'On Monday Spurs travel to Watford, who are also enjoying a fine campaign. Alex Neil\u2019s Norwich, meanwhile, host Aston Villa, who are enduring an awful one. Nothing less than victory will satisfy either side.', u'The City manager said: \u201cThey will be approaching it as a must-win game from their point of view and we will approach it knowing that we are desperate to get the three points as well. If we pick up a win in the next game it will take us to 20 points at the halfway mark.', u'\u201cPeople talk about the 40-point mark and stuff. It\u2019s not been a target that I\u2019ve set for the players but it shows that we are not far away from being safe.\u201d', u'Man of the match Dele Alli (Tottenham)', u'Sign in\nor create your Guardian account to join the discussion.\n', u'This discussion is closed for comments.', u'\nWe\u2019re doing some maintenance right now.

Try not to get too comfy, though, you\u2019ve been here two seconds and you still haven\u2019t won anything. Maybe the Normal One is too normal. What was all the fuss about? What kind of managerial genius loses 3-0 to Watford? Klopp for the chop.', u' Related: Christian Benteke strikes as Liverpool end Leicester City\u2019s unbeaten run ', u'Forgive the facetiousness, but Liverpool\u2019s 2-2 draw with West Bromwich Albion two weeks ago was portrayed as a telling moment in Klopp\u2019s tenure. He had three wins, three draws, two defeats, 12 goals scored and nine conceded from his first eight league games in charge. Brendan Rodgers had three wins, three draws, two defeats and a goal difference of minus two after his final eight games at Liverpool.', u'Stripped of context, those numbers were potentially troubling. Yet Liverpool were drifting under Rodgers and, while it is too soon to say that they are going places under Klopp, it is clear that the German has a plan, a coherent way of playing and the kind of magnetic personality that convinces his players to come along for the ride, wherever the hell they end up.', u'Klopp\u2019s football was scintillating during the good times at Borussia Dortmund and it is not hard to see him eventually ending Liverpool\u2019s long wait for a league title if he is given time, space and support. Yet it is also tempting to wonder how long the honeymoon period will last, especially if Liverpool look like finishing outside the top four.', u'Ars\xe8ne Wenger never bothers to hide the weariness in his voice when he observes that we are living in the age of impatience. Managers are obvious victims, rewarded with hefty contracts one minute and slapped in the face with P45s the next, even when they are not solely to blame. \u201cThe society today always wants something new,\u201d Wenger said last week. \u201cWe have news every half an hour or every minute. You need to announce something new. But let\u2019s not forget that football is as well about cohesion, about stability.\u201d', u'The sacking culture is corrosive. We have become accustomed to speculation about who will be the next sucker to lose his job, as though football is a reality television show in which the least popular contestant gets voted off and the flavour of the month takes his place, and too often we are blind to the potential rewards of keeping faith with a beleaguered manager, ignoring the possibility that results can improve if people are allowed to learn from their mistakes. The fear of even brief failure stunts a club\u2019s growth and development.', u'Just as it is worth remembering that Sir Alex Ferguson needed six and a half years to win the first of his 13 league titles in England, it is striking that Wenger is tantalisingly close to seeing his third great Arsenal side emerge. Arsenal should be regarded as title favourites after last week\u2019s victory over Manchester City and, although they still have to convince us that they will stay well clear of the self-destruct button, they have matured hugely this year.', u'Wenger winning the league for the first time in 12 years could be a major turning point for managers in England. Arsenal have had to hold their nerve since the Invincibles swept to glory in 2004 and there have been a couple of occasions over the past decade when sacking Wenger would have been justifiable.', u'The 8-2 defeat by Manchester United in 2011 was a potential breaking point. So was the 6-0 defeat by Chelsea in Wenger\u2019s 1,000th game, while there have been needless embarrassments against lesser sides in the cups, and a sense that Arsenal are only ever one setback from crumbling. How they respond after Boxing Day\u2019s fiasco at Southampton will be crucial.', u'Yet if the title arrives at the Emirates Stadium for the first time since Wenger led Arsenal to the ground in 2006 it will be seen as a victory for stability, loyalty and forward planning, and plenty of managers should be secretly cheering them on. When clubs get twitchy in dark times, it would demonstrate the value of patience. Take Liverpool, whose owners would have to take note and stick with Klopp if he is still struggling to get his ideas across in a year or two.', u'It is true that not every manager deserves time and some are promoted too soon, jumping into Premier League jobs instead of learning their trade at a lower level. Garry Monk comes to mind. Despite leading Swansea City to eighth place last season, he was exposed as soon as results deteriorated. Swansea\u2019s chairman, Huw Jenkins, is not a fool.', u'Equally Monk\u2019s sacking was part of a trend, a swift rise followed by a sharp descent. On to the next one, then the next. Sometimes it is impossible to know if a manager was good enough, because no one sees them for long enough to reach a definitive conclusion.', u'Snap judgments scrub out football\u2019s shades of grey. Every issue becomes black and white, yet managers are not always the ones at fault. The root causes of failure can often be found in a club\u2019s structure or its recruitment. United may get a quick fix if they replace Louis van Gaal with Jos\xe9 Mourinho, but it is unlikely to be a lasting cure. They are a good advert for having a director of football.', u'When Klopp arrived at Liverpool, he found a squad lacking belief, courage, cohesion, drive, moxie and quality. The players\u2019 flaws did not magically disappear when Rodgers was ushered out of Anfield in October and even when Liverpool were playing their part in Mourinho\u2019s demise at Chelsea and racing into a 3-0 lead at Manchester City inside 32 minutes, Klopp was telling people not to get carried away. He sounds like Wenger in those moments. Whether his bosses will have the foresight to listen remains to be seen.', u'Sign in\nor create your Guardian account to join the discussion.\n', u'This discussion is closed for comments.', u'\nWe\u2019re doing some maintenance right now.

A budding pianist \u2013 he took his grade 4 exam last year - Balls recently started working as a cookery writer for the rightwing Spectator magazine.', u'His debut column, on how to perfect a crab and Gruy\xe8re souffle Christmas starter, should stand him in good stead with Smith, a Norwich City shareholder with whom he will be able to swap recipes and garner tips.', u'In a statement, Balls said: \u201cIt\u2019s an honour and a privilege to be asked to join the board of directors at Norwich City as chairman.', u'\u201cFrom the moment my dad first took me to watch City from the terrace at Carrow Road in 1973, my earliest ambition was to play for the club I loved. But the next best thing is to become chairman of Norwich City and do what I can off the pitch to help City succeed on the pitch.', u'\u201cThe club\u2019s immediate priority and focus is, of course, the retention of our hard-earned Premier League status, and the hard work of my fellow directors and all of my colleagues at the club means Norwich City is in great shape on and off the pitch going into 2016.', u'\u201cWith that foundation, the challenge for all of us at Norwich is to go from the up-and-down fortunes I have known since I was a boy to an era of sustained success, and I will be proud to play my part in that.\u201d', u'Balls, who is married to the former shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, with whom he has three children, left an opponent with a bloodied eye following a tackle during a charity match in September 2014.', u'Born at Norfolk and Norwich hospital, Balls moved with his family to Nottingham aged eight, having attended Bawburgh County primary school.

Keegan\u2019s side, nicknamed the Entertainers, were on a great run of results and part of a sport repairing its image after the violence that seemed to follow it around over the previous couple of decades. Blair and Alastair Campbell wanted to highlight the similarities with their New Labour project. It helped, too, that Blair was a Newcastle fan.', u'Blair was also fond of a photo opportunity with the former Manchester United manager and staunch Labour supporter Sir Alex Ferguson, while Campbell has always been forthright in his support for Burnley.

guardian [u'\nRichard Rae at the City Ground', u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 13.54\xa0EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sunday 27 December 2015 17.01\xa0EST\n\n', u'Quite how long the footballing deities are going to make Leeds United keep paying for the sins of previous eras remains to be seen, but as if being owned by a convicted fraudster and being without a shirt sponsor was not enough, Sam Byram, the classy young midfielder whose sweetly hit shot secured a point that was the least they deserved from this match, was probably playing one of his last games for the club.', u'The versatile 22-year-old has refused to sign a new contract and is expected to move on during the transfer window, with Liverpool at the head of a queue of Premier League clubs looking to acquire his services at a relatively knock-down price. \u201cSam has a decision to make,\u201d said Steve Evans, the Leeds manager. \u201cI saw a man whose performance suggested he wanted to stay at the club, and I think maybe privately he would say that. He wasn\u2019t in good form when I came to the club, but now he is and today he was outstanding.', u' Related: How Massimo Cellino still controls Leeds United despite two bans ', u'\u201cAnd isn\u2019t it just nice of the Football League to give us a fixture [on Tuesday] against a team as good as Derby, two days after we appear here and they get an extra 30 hours to recover. That\u2019s not right for football and the integrity of the competition.\u201d', u'History, and the fact it was pretty much the only game in town, ensured a level of interest in this match that the positions occupied by these teams coming into the game \u2013 15th against 13th \u2013 might otherwise have struggled to justify. In fairness, however, both have found a measure of form in recent weeks, Forest having won four in a row at home, and become harder to beat away, while Leeds were unbeaten in four, three of which were victories.', u'Leeds settled more quickly in terms of looking comfortable in possession, but little had been created by either side when Forest went ahead with a N\xe9lson Oliveira goal which owed far too much to poor decision-making by the Leeds centre-back Giuseppe Bellusci and goalkeeper Marco Silvestri. Bellusci should have cut out Matt Mills\u2019 long ball but when he failed to do so \u2013 and went to ground \u2013 Silvestri should have kicked the ball clear. His hesitation, however, allowed Oliveira to touch the ball past him before side-footing into the empty net, his sixth goal of the season.', u'The game then resumed its previous pattern, Leeds having the considerable majority of possession \u2013 74% in the first-half, according to the official stats - and looking neat and purposeful until they got close to the Forest penalty area, where Chris Wood was getting little change from Mills and Jack Hobbs. Forest, with David Vaughan the game\u2019s dominant influence, looked the more dangerous side going forward but created as many chances as Leeds, which is to say none.', u'Other than the goal, Oliveira\u2019s free-kick over the bar from 20 yards shortly after the start of the second half was Forest\u2019s first really decent shooting opportunity. As was Wood\u2019s volley for Leeds a few minutes later, which the New Zealander sliced high and wide, but at least the game was becoming a little more stretched.', u'Shortly before the hour Mills met Henri Lansbury\u2019s corner with a header which Luke Murphy kicked off the line, and at last the chances started to come, although it required a shot of real class from Byram to beat Dorus de Vries in the Forest goal.', u'Both sides could have won it, Mirco Antenucci and Wood missing good chances for Leeds, but it was the Forest substitute Oliver Burke who went closest with a shot from outside the penalty area that beat Silvestri all ends up but came back off the inside of the goalkeeper\u2019s right-hand post.', u'\u201cWe were the totally dominant team playing all the football \u2013 we made enough chances to win the game and if they\u2019d won, it would have been a travesty,\u201d Evans added.', u'The Forest manager Dougie Freedman, who did not shake hands with Evans after the game, made no apologies for playing a counterattacking game, despite his team being at home. \u201cI felt we controlled the game out of possession,\u201d he said.', u'\u201cYou have to look at the best way to win the game. Individually Leeds have good players and I felt it was working \u2013 but we did need to kill them off, we had the chances to do so, and the disappointment was that we failed to do so.\u201d', u'Man of the match David Vaughan (Nottingham Forest)', u'Sign in\nor create your Guardian account to join the discussion.\n', u'This discussion is closed for comments.', u'\nWe\u2019re doing some maintenance right now.

There are shades of David Peace\u2019s The Damned United in this fixture, too, given Brian Clough\u2019s contrasting success at each club.', u'The last meeting was an endearing stalemate in March earlier this year, but before that, goodness gracious me, there were some crackers. Just four years ago these two played out a ten-goal thriller at Elland Road, with Leeds on the receiving end of a 7-3 spanking. Garath McCleary helped himself not to a hat-trick but four goals for Forest while Mikael Forssell remained unmoved on the home bench. Later that year, Forest put four more past a sorry looking El Hadji Diouf and his Leeds team-mates.', u'Today, unlike Diouf\u2019s gold Cadillacs and chrome McLaren\u2019s, neither side is exactly glistening. Forest are under a transfer embargo after breaching FFP rules and Leeds, although in blistering winter form, are hardly where they would like to be, although they are one point in front of today\u2019s hosts. The Forest manager, Dougie Freedman, who has played in this fixture as a player, has not had chance to celebrate a victory on the road since September but a fifth consecutive home win would lift them into the top half. ', u'Henri Lansbury and Jamie Ward boast the je ne sais quoi needed to win games like this, while Dexter Blackstock, who has been around this division forever, always seems good value off the bench. Steve Evans\u2019 side will put up a fight though, and you suspect on loan midfielder Liam Bridcutt and the much talked of local lad Sam Byram will play key roles in preventing Forest potentially running riot, again. ', u'Kick-off: 4.30pm GMT', u'Updated at 1.20pm GMT']

No. Ronny Deila\u2019s post-match talk about getting his \u2018old team\u2019 back following the previous weekend\u2019s aberration at home to Motherwell probably reflects more on the poverty of that performance than the fleeting moments of quality produced on Sunday.', u'Osman Sow fires home the equaliser, with the help of a deflection, to salvage a point for Hearts', u"Tom Rogic (right) curls home from the edge of the box and thought he'd claimed all three points\xa0", u'Yet Hearts had to stretch every sinew and use every available second to snatch a 2-2 draw, with injury-time equalisers in either half giving the home side a result that they arguably deserved.', u'It would take a very hard heart to suggest that Celtic weren\u2019t equally deserving of the draw, given the obstacles overcome here.

Here was a contest that lived up to all the best traditions of this fixture.', u'Nir Bitton opened the scoring for Celtic as he neatly slipped the ball past Hearts keeper Neil Alexander', u'The Israel international was put through beautifully by Callum McGregor and made no mistake\xa0', u'Hearts boss Robbie Neilson hit the nail on the head when, last week, he described this game as a kind of stand-in for the usual derby clashes enjoyed by both clubs; without Hibs or Rangers to test themselves against, Hearts and Celtic have found willing sparring partners in each other.', u'Throw in the Edinburgh v Glasgow element, too, and we had the recipe for a genuinely exciting afternoon.

What a sickener, right?

sky [u'\n\n\nFootball\n\n\nNews\n', u'Last Updated: 28/12/15 12:45pm', u'Arsenal are reportedly set to strengthen their midfield with the signing of Egypt international Mohamed Elneny in the January transfer window.', u"Arsene Wenger was coy when quizzed on the Basel midfielder by Sky Sports News HQ in the wake of Arsenal's 4-0 defeat by Southampton on Boxing Day, but the Daily Mirror say the Gunners are hopeful of wrapping up a deal for the 23-year-old having agreed a \xa35m fee.", u"So who exactly is Elneny? And how would he fit in at Arsenal? Here, we take a look at the player's credentials\u2026", u'Background', u'Elneny came through the youth ranks at Al-Ahly before moving to Egyptian Premier League rivals El Mokawloon, where he broke into the first team alongside Mohamed Salah, who he says is "like a brother" to him. Basel clinched the signing of Salah in the summer of 2012, and six months later Elneny followed his former team-mate to Switzerland.', u'                    Arsenal must strengthen in the January transfer window, according to the Sunday Supplement panel.                ', u'He initially signed for Basel on loan but made the move permanent in May 2013. The midfielder has become a key player since then, making close to 100 Swiss Super League appearances and helping Basel win three consecutive titles. He has featured in Europa League clashes with Tottenham and Champions League ties against Chelsea and Liverpool, and this season has been his best yet, with six goals in 28 appearances in all competitions.', u'Elneny is also an established Egypt international. He represented his country as they reached the quarter-finals at the London 2012 Olympics, and in total he has made 40 appearances for the national team, scoring three times.', u'Strengths and style of play', u'Elneny is a deep-lying central midfielder who stands at 5ft 11in. He has the energy and pace to get up and down the pitch and he is as comfortable attacking as he is defending.', u"The 23-year-old has become known for his impressive range of passing at Basel and he also likes to shoot from distance, with a number of his recent goals coming from outside the box. Elneny is one of Basel's favoured set-piece takers, and as well as being technically accomplished, he is physically strong and tough in the tackle.", u"                    Arsenal's beleaguered players have the spirit to hit back against Bournemouth, says Arsene Wenger.                ", u"Elneny was particularly impressive in Basel's Europa League group campaign this season. He scored twice in five appearances, his pass accuracy of 92.4 per cent was the highest at the club, and he also ranked highly for tackles (2.4 per game) and interceptions (2.0 per game).", u'Premier League dream', u'In an interview with the Cairo Post in April, Elneny claimed he had received "several offers" from other clubs and confirmed his ambition to move to the Premier League.', u'"The Premier League is a big dream for any player, and I hope to move there one day," Elneny said. "But I am entirely focused on finishing the season with Basel outstandingly, and then I will think about offers from any other clubs."', u'In the same interview, Elneny also revealed he had already started learning English.', u'Arsenal role?', u'Elneny would provide much-needed cover for Arsenal in central midfield, both in the short-term and the long-term. The Gunners are currently without the likes of Francis Coquelin, Santi Cazorla and Jack Wilshere due to injuries, while Mikel Arteta, Tomas Rosicky and Mathieu Flamini are out of contract in the summer.', u'Elneny is an all-rounder who could play in a number of different roles for the Gunners, but he would primarily offer support to Coquelin as an extra defensive midfielder.', u'The Egyptian would have to adjust to the rigours of Premier League football, but having only turned 23 in July, there would be plenty of room for development.', u'\n\n\n\n      \xa92015 Sky\n    ']

guardian [u'\n\nSunday 27 December 2015 11.22\xa0EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sunday 27 December 2015 17.00\xa0EST\n\n', u'Considering Manchester United\u2019s game against Chelsea on Monday evening pits Louis van Gaal against his compatriot Guus Hiddink, his replacement as Holland coach in the summer of 2014, it is worth remembering Van Gaal\u2019s tactical approach that took the Dutch to third place at the World Cup.', u'In charge of an unusually poor group of players, Van Gaal played a cautious counterattacking game, generally sacrificing possession and encouraging his players to use the ball as quickly as possible. Arjen Robben was unquestionably the main man but Robin van Persie\u2019s magnificent header against Spain, from Daley Blind\u2019s long pass, was a perfect example of Holland\u2019s urgency and directness.', u'Since taking charge of United, Van Gaal has preached the exact opposite approach \u2013 he is obsessed with dominating possession, and therefore his players are astonishingly conservative with their use of the ball.', u'On paper, that usual approach should play into the hands of Chelsea \u2013 even if the defending Premier League champions are understandably strategically uncertain just a week into the Hiddink regime. Chelsea will surely arrive at Old Trafford determined to play on the counterattack, particularly as Hiddink will be keen to improve Chelsea\u2019s poor defensive organisation before concentrating on attack.', u' Related: Louis van Gaal criticises players at Stoke and attacks headline \u2018rubbish\u2019 ', u'Besides, this is a team naturally geared to play on the break \u2013 with Diego Costa suspended, the quick Lo\xefc R\xe9my is likely to start upfront and make constant darting runs into the channels. Meanwhile, Pedro Rodr\xedguez and Willian ensure Chelsea have plenty of players capable of carrying the ball forward from deep, even if Eden Hazard misses out through injury.', u'United have suffered against counter-attacking teams in recent weeks, particularly when pushing their full-backs high up the pitch. Here, Van Gaal is in a no-win situation, because he has often been forced to field makeshift full-backs such as the midfielder Blind and the winger Ashley Young: if they push forward they leave the centre-backs exposed, but if they sit deep they\u2019re negating their natural strengths.', u'Blind struggles against quick players in one-against-one situations out wide, while Young simply doesn\u2019t have the natural defensive instinct to anticipate danger and adjust his position accordingly. Against such a pacy Chelsea attack, United could be overrun at the back if they push up the pitch routinely. The answer for Van Gaal is surely to negate Chelsea\u2019s counterattacking threat \u2013 and therefore playing counterattacking football himself.', u'That is not the type of football United fans want to see at home against a bottom-half side, but then it\u2019s hardly any more boring than an approach which has seen United average the highest share of possession in the league, but only the 16th-highest number of shots. They would surely be best off sitting back and breaking sporadically, using the pace of Anthony Martial and perhaps the energy of Ander Herrera.', u'Van Gaal\u2019s team selection will be determined largely by attempting to rotate his side just two days after the 2-0 defeat to Stoke City. He is fortunate to be welcoming back Bastian Schweinsteiger \u2013 presumably perfectly fresh after serving a three-game suspension \u2013 while Morgan Schneiderlin should start alongside him having been omitted in recent weeks.', u'The headline decision will be whether Van Gaal hands a start to Wayne Rooney, who was omitted against Stoke. But, realistically, the key decision is Van Gaal\u2019s overall gameplan: if United sit back, counterattack and triumph like Van Gaal did regularly with Holland, it could be a season-changing game.', u'If not, United\u2019s hierarchy might attempt to find someone capable of setting up the side in such a manner \u2013 and that, of course, would surely mean Jos\xe9 Mourinho.', u'Sign in\nor create your Guardian account to join the discussion.\n', u'This discussion is closed for comments.', u'\nWe\u2019re doing some maintenance right now.

However, for Van Gaal his first stint in the Holland hotseat was disastrous.\xa0Hired with the aim of having a successful 2002 World Cup, the Dutchman failed in his quest to even qualify for the showpiece event in Japan and South Korea.\xa0', u'Holland finished behind Portugal and Ireland in their qualification group and Van Gaal had no choice but to resign in January 2002.', u"Van Gaal cuts a crestfallen figure after Holland's 1-0 World Cup qualification defeat by Ireland in 2001", u'BARCELONA (2002-03)', u'HOW HE LEFT: SACKED', u'Van Gaal returned to Barca for a second spell at the the start of the 2002-03 term, but like his first stint it ended abruptly and in acrimonious fashion.\xa0', u'While succeeding in Europe, the Nou Camp outfit were struggling domestically. By the start of February they were just three points above the relegation zone in 12th place, and 20 points behind league leaders Real Sociedad, having already lost eight La Liga fixtures.

In reality that piece of paper was quickly torn up as Van Gaal lasted less than a year in the role. Constant public feuds with Koeman led to Van Gaal resigning 'in the best interests.'", u"'My resignation is in Ajax's best interests and has nothing to do with the poor results this season,' he said in a press conference following his decision.\xa0", u'Van Gaal has got the better of Koeman twice since the pair joined the Premier League last season, although the Southampton boss has recorded a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford too.', u'Van Gaal resigned as technical director of Ajax in 2004 after falling out with then-manager Ronald Koeman', u'AZ ALKMAAR (2005-09)', u'HOW HE LEFT: RESIGNED', u'A topsy-turvy four-year spell with the Eredivisie side saw Van Gaal resign from the club before a player-led decision forced him to change his mind. He stepped away for good a season later.\xa0', u"After second and third-place finishes, the Dutchman chose to resign after AZ Alkmaar's 11th position finish at the end of 2007-08 term. However, after being persuaded to think differently by his players, Van Gaal's u-turn proved a wise move as the club proceeded to win their first league title in 28 years the following campaign - which included a 28-game unbeaten run.\xa0", u'He left on a high note to join Bayern Munich.', u'AZ Alkmaar players celebrate with Van Gaal after their 2008 Eredvisie title success', u'BAYERN MUNICH (2009-11)', u'HOW HE LEFT: SACKED', u"Van Gaal's debut campaign in Germany saw him overturn a poor start to the season to guide them to a league and cup double.

Osman Sow\u2019s thunderous equaliser salvages a draw for Hearts and Celtic are forced to settle for a point that edges them one clear of Aberdeen at the top of the table. Celtic lost the lead twice and they will be kicking themselves. They\u2019ve picked up one point from their last two games but they do have a game in hand on Aberdeen, so it could be worse. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.', u' 3.52pm GMT10:52 ', u'90 min+3: Hearts have another free-kick in the Celtic half, near the centre circle. Another opportunity to pressurise Celtic. But nothing comes from it. One minute to go.', u' 3.51pm GMT10:51 ', u'Just as the board goes up to show four minutes of stoppage time, Sow rescues a point for Hearts with a preposterous goal! Bauben taps the free-kick to Sow and he spanks a wobbler into the top right corner from 30 yards! The ball moved a thousand different directions in the way - possibly because of a deflection off Mackay-Steven - and Gordon could only stand and watch.', u' 3.49pm GMT10:49 ', u'90 min: King is tripped 30 yards from goal. Here\u2019s a chance for Hearts!', u' 3.48pm GMT10:48 ', u'88 min: The lively Billy King scoots inside from the right, but his left-footer is drilled a few yards wide of the near post.', u' 3.46pm GMT10:46 ', u'87 min: Hearts bring on Zanatta for Gomis. \u201cI take Raymond Reardon\u2019s point,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cBut maybe Dundee could go down instead?\u201d', u' 3.46pm GMT10:46 ', u'86 min: Or maybe there are. King sends a superb cross into the six-yard box, but it\u2019s headed away by Ambrose.', u' 3.45pm GMT10:45 ', u'85 min: There aren\u2019t too many signs of a Hearts equaliser.', u' 3.41pm GMT10:41 ', u'81 min: Just booked, Ciftci pushes his luck with an overly aggressive attempt to win the ball. He gets away with it.', u' 3.40pm GMT10:40 ', u'80 min: Hearts bring on King for Reilly.', u' 3.38pm GMT10:38 ', u'79 min: Oshaniwa provokes the ire of the home fans with a dismal cross. Then it\u2019s the turn of the referee to wind them up when he decides not to send off Ciftci for leading with an arm in an aerial challenge with Augustyn. Ciftci is booked.', u'Updated at 3.39pm GMT', u' 3.37pm GMT10:37 ', u'78 min: Tom Rogic, who looks like being the matchwinner, is replaced by Gary Mackay-Steven. ', u' 3.36pm GMT10:36 ', u'77 min: No, they can\u2019t, the corner is a risible disgrace.', u' 3.36pm GMT10:36 ', u'76 min: Hearts have been struggling to build any momentum since the Celtic goal, but they\u2019ve got a corner here. Can they do anything with it?', u' 3.32pm GMT10:32 ', u'73 min: Lustig attempts to find Ciftci in the area with a cross from the right. It\u2019s headed behind for a corner on the right. Lustig heads the corner over at the near post.', u' 3.31pm GMT10:31 ', u'72 min: Ambrose makes a timely intervention to stop a surge from Bauben on the edge of the Celtic area. \u201cAs SPL teams are precluded from ground sharing, Dundee United, by dropping a division would allow for a sparkling new stadium to be built in Dundee that could be shared by both Dundee teams if say Dundee United stayed down for say 5 years,\u201d says Raymond Reardon.\u201d If Simon McMahon could see the benefit of society\u2019s greater good at this time of the year rather than singular selfish hopes.\u201d', u' 3.30pm GMT10:30 ', u'This has been coming. The ball breaks to Rogic on the edge of the area. He opens up his body, picks his spot and guides a beautiful shot into the top right corner with his left foot, the ball satisfyingly thudding into the net off the underside of the bar. That is a superb goal.', u' 3.29pm GMT10:29 ', u'69 min: Bauben slides a ball through to Reilly, piercing the Celtic defence, but the alert Gordon smothers it. \u201cTynecastle is certainly one of the most atmospheric grounds in Scotland, the crowd being very close to the pitch,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cSounds like a good game, Celtic softening the Jambos up for when United visit on Wednesday. I\u2019m actually in the kitchen preparing for the annual mother-in-law Christmas visit. She\u2019s been coming round to our house at Christmas for 20 years now. This year we\u2019re going to let her in. HONK!\u201d', u' 3.26pm GMT10:26 ', u'67 min: Celtic are utterly dominant. A second goal looks likely.', u' 3.23pm GMT10:23 ', u'64 min: Augustyn is booked for fouling Ciftci on the right flank. He\u2019s not impressed, arguing that he should have had a free-kick for an earlier incident.', u' 3.21pm GMT10:21 ', u'62 min: Hearts bring on Pallardo for the injured Djoum.', u' 3.21pm GMT10:21 ', u'61 min: Forrest picks up the ball on the left touchline, drops a shoulder and dips inside. He moves ominously on to his right foot, but he drags a shot wide from the edge of the area.', u' 3.18pm GMT10:18 ', u'58 min: Lustig darts down the right and pings a cross into the Hearts area. It\u2019s met on the run by Johansen, but the Celtic midfielder clips his effort well wide.', u' 3.15pm GMT10:15 ', u'55 min: A lull. This game is excellently poised. It\u2019s so even.', u' 3.11pm GMT10:11 ', u'52 min: After an age, both players are back to their feet. Ambrose is booked and the free-kick is wastefully directed straight to the first man. All that wait for nothing.', u' 3.10pm GMT10:10 ', u'50 min: Oshaniwa and Lustig are back. Rejoice! Play resumes with Hearts probing down the left. Djoum nicks the ball round the lumbering Ambrose, who clumsily chops him down and manages to injure himself in the process. Djoum is also down. A yellow card awaits Ambrose when he gets up.', u' 3.08pm GMT10:08 ', u'49 min: Oshaniwa is the first to get back to his feet and he\u2019s soon followed by Lustig, who limps off gingerly. Both teams are down to 10 men for the time being.', u' 3.07pm GMT10:07 ', u'48 min: Play is stopped after a heavy collision between Oshaniwa and Lustig. They both need urgent treatment. Celtic have already seen two players gone off injured.', u' 3.06pm GMT10:06 ', u'46 min: Off we go again! Let\u2019s hope that the second half is as engrossing as the first. It will be if this is anything to go by. Augustyn makes a hot piping mess out of a simple clearance on the left and he has his pocket pinched by Ciftci, who drives into the area and wallops a low blast towards the far corner, only to be denied by a magnificent save from a fuming Alexander.', u' 2.50pm GMT09:50 ', u'That was very entertaining.', u' 2.49pm GMT09:49 ', u'What a brilliant goal. Bauben is allowed too much space on the right and from a deep position he swings a cross towards the far post, where Nicholson has the run on Lustig. The right-back tries to put Nicholson off but he\u2019s floundering; Nicholson leaps into a gleeful volley with the outside of his right boot and the ball flies past Gordon and into the top left corner! Hearts deserve that. What a response.', u'Updated at 2.49pm GMT', u' 2.47pm GMT09:47 ', u'45 min: Celtic fancy a second before half-time. Forrest diddles his way into the area from the left and he\u2019s almost tripped by Augustyn. He stays on his feet and reaches the byline, but his cutback, intended for Ciftci, is cut out. There will be three minutes of stoppage time.', u' 2.45pm GMT09:45 ', u'All that Hearts pressure and now look. Hearts fail to clear the ball properly and when it falls to McGregor 40 yards from goal, he shows good composure to pick out the unmarked Bitton with a cool pass through to the midfielder. Hearts are all over the place and Bitton takes a touch, opens up his body and calmly slips the ball past the helpless Alexander.', u' 2.41pm GMT09:41 ', u'40 min: Reilly is tormenting the Celtic back four. They can\u2019t handle him. He beats two of them to a long ball down the right and he lifts a cross to the far post. However Nicholson is stretching and he can only volley wide.', u' 2.39pm GMT09:39 ', u'38 min: Celtic absolutely bossed the first 10 minutes, but they are rocking at the moment. Those two substitutions appear to have disrupted them and remember, they were already without Leigh Griffiths and Scott Brown.', u' 2.39pm GMT09:39 ', u'36 min: With Ambrose badly off the pace, Reilly speeds on to a long ball over the top and away from the dozing Celtic substitute. Reilly is through on goal and he aims for the far post with his left foot. However he slightly scuffs it and Gordon comes to Celtic\u2019s rescue again, pushing the ball wide with his left hand. The corner comes to nothing, despite Hearts testing Celtic\u2019s strength in the air, keeping the ball alive for as long as possible, before it\u2019s eventually claimed by Gordon.', u' 2.37pm GMT09:37 ', u'34 min: Djoum escapes down the left for Hearts, who are well on top at the moment, and slides a dangerous low ball across the face of goal. Reilly, sliding in, can\u2019t meet it but it reaches Bauben at the far post. He shovels it towards goal and it looks like he\u2019s going to score the opener - but he can\u2019t quite get enough power on his effort and Gordon somehow dives to his left and claws it off the line and away for a corner! What a save. The Hearts goalkeeper reacts like he\u2019s just scored the winner.', u' 2.35pm GMT09:35 ', u'33 min: The substitute is finally made. Efe Ambrose is on for Boyata. Ambrose is cheered on by the Hearts fans, who have seen him make the odd howler or two.', u'Updated at 3.13pm GMT', u' 2.32pm GMT09:32 ', u'30 min: Boyata is limping and clutching his hamstring. He tries to walk it off, but to no avail. He falls to the turf and he\u2019ll surely have to go off.', u' 2.30pm GMT09:30 ', u'29 min: Celtic get the free-kick away, but this is turning into a tricky spell for them.', u' 2.30pm GMT09:30 ', u'28 min: A loose touch from Lustig inside the Celtic half presents the ball to Nicholson. He shows a lovely imaginative touch by knocking the ball over Lustig\u2019s head and making towards the left flank, only to be sent flying by a poorly timed tackle from behind by Johansen, who rightly picks up a booking.', u' 2.28pm GMT09:28 ', u'27 min: Hearts take a short corner. Statistics show that they never work.', u' 2.28pm GMT09:28 ', u'26 min: The corner from Gomis is headed away as far as the edge of the Celtic area. Nicholson\u2019s tame volley is easily held by Gordon, but it\u2019s not long before Hearts win another corner on the right.', u' 2.27pm GMT09:27 ', u'25 min: Nicholson flicks a throw-in down the line and Reilly momentarily peels away from Boyata, who uses his speed to recover well and concede a corner on the left.', u' 2.26pm GMT09:26 ', u'24 min: A cross from Lustig from the right reaches Forrest at the far post. He controls on his chest, lobs the ball inside, over a defender\u2019s head, and balloons a volley miles over the bar. Everything was brilliant there, except for the finish.', u' 2.25pm GMT09:25 ', u'23 min: This is much better from Hearts, who are beginning to pressure Celtic higher up the pitch. Their fans are responding to their intensity.', u' 2.22pm GMT09:22 ', u'21 min: Here comes the Celtic change. Forrest on, Armstrong off.', u' 2.22pm GMT09:22 ', u'20 min: Celtic are preparing to bring on James Forrest. Armstrong has picked up a knock and won\u2019t be able to continue.', u' 2.19pm GMT09:19 ', u'17 min: Armstrong curls the free-kick into the Hearts area; it\u2019s headed behind for a corner by Sow. Armstrong trots across to take the corner. It\u2019s not a particularly good delivery, once again, but it\u2019s allowed to bounce all the way to the far post. Simunovic stoops and nods it towards goal, but it\u2019s straight at Alexander.', u' 2.17pm GMT09:17 ', u'16 min: Parker is given a severe talking to by the referee after reacting angrily to being penalised for a foul on the left. Celtic have a free-kick in a promising position.', u' 2.16pm GMT09:16 ', u'13 min: Heart attack for the first time. The ball is knocked long and Celtic\u2019s centre-backs threaten to make one hell of a dog\u2019s dinner out of getting it away. Simunovic heads it weakly back towards his own goal and with Craig Gordon not commanding enough in the Celtic goal as he attempts to smother the ball, Boyata hurriedly clears it away under severe pressure from Reilly.', u' 2.12pm GMT09:12 ', u'10 min: The pitch appears to be sloped towards the Hearts goal, which isn\u2019t very fair.', u' 2.10pm GMT09:10 ', u'8 min: Celtic are passing and moving sweetly. They win another corner on the right. However McGregor disappoints again with his delivery, the ball headed away at the near post.', u' 2.09pm GMT09:09 ', u'7 min: Hearts are nervous. They need to wake up. They give the ball away near their own area. Rogic uses his strength to muscle off a challenge, before thumping a shot goalwards. Alexander dives to his right to save and hold it.', u' 2.08pm GMT09:08 ', u'6 min: Rogic gets his head up, gliding away from the Hearts midfield, and he rolls a pass through to Ciftci. He\u2019s clear on the area and the ball is on his right foot. His first touch is good and his short towards the bottom right is struck firmly, but too close to Alexander, who saves it with a strong hand before jumping on the ball before anyone can tap home the rebound.', u' 2.07pm GMT09:07 ', u'5 min: Celtic look up for this. Ciftci cifts the ball on to his right foot and has a pop from 25 yards, looking to curl the ball into the top left. It sails over.', u' 2.06pm GMT09:06 ', u'4 min: Let\u2019s try a quick poll. Do Celtic fans miss Rangers or do they want them to stay right where they are?', u' 2.03pm GMT09:03 ', u'2 min: Celtic attack instantly, McGregor bursting down the right and winning a corner. That was too easy. However the corner comes out, McGregor\u2019s overhit delivery drifting out for a goal-kick.', u' 2.02pm GMT09:02 ', u'And we\u2019re off! Hearts, kicking from right to left, get the game underway. Tynecastle is loud. The home fans fancy this.', u' 1.59pm GMT08:59 ', u'Here come the teams! Hearts look confident and why not, Leigh Griffiths is out for Celtic. I\u2019m a body language expert.', u' 1.56pm GMT08:56 ', u'\u201cWhile I recognize your good sentiments especially given the festive season in telling Simon McMahon that all will be well for his beloved Dundee United, methinks that giving false hope might do more harm than good,\u201d says Mike Mackenzie. \u201cI suspect it will take a divine intervention for Simon\u2019s club to avoid the drop.\u201d', u'To be honest, I didn\u2019t read the email, it could be detailing the many reasons why Donald Trump is such a great lad. I\u2019m just delighted to see I\u2019ve doubled my readership!', u' 1.41pm GMT08:41 ', u'Celtic, of course, are coming into this off the back of a 2-1 defeat at home to Motherwell. That was a shock and Hearts will be eager to see if Celtic are still vulnerable after that setback.', u' 1.38pm GMT08:38 ', u'\u201cAfternoon Jacob,\u201d says Simon McMahon, who might be my only reader today. \u201cLooking at today\u2019s line-ups is making me all nostalgic. It\u2019s like a Dundee United select from the last 5 years. Gomis and Buaben both played for us when we last won a trophy, the Scottish Cup in 2010, and Armstrong, Ciftci and Mackay-Steven were all at Tannadice this time last year, when we were riding high in the league and on our way to the League Cup final. Scott Allan started his career with United too. But look at us now. Just the 10 points behind the team in second bottom. With a trip to Tynecastle on Wednesday, then Dens on January 2. Oh United! Tell me it\u2019ll be ok, Jacob. Please.\u201d', u'It will be ok, Simon. ', u' 1.08pm GMT08:08 ', u'These two have met twice already this season. It was a 0-0 draw at Celtic Park in the league in September and a 2-1 win for Celtic when they visited Hearts in the League Cup quarter-final in October.', u' 1.05pm GMT08:05 ', u'Hearts: Alexander, Paterson, Augustyn, Rossi, Oshaniwa, Bauben, Djoum, Gomis, Nicholson, Reilly, Sow. Subs: Hamilton, McGhee, Ozturk, Pallardo, Swanson, King, Zanatta.', u'Celtic: Gordon; Lustig, Boyata, Simunovic, Tierney; Bitton, Johansen; McGregor, Rogic, Armstrong; Ciftci. Subs: Bailly, Izaguirre, Ambrose, Allan, Mackay-Steven, Cole, Forrest.', u'Referee: Steve McLean.', u' 10.44am GMT05:44 ', u'Hello. There\u2019s an interesting look at the top of the Scottish Premiership, but it\u2019s a little deceptive. They\u2019ve got joint leaders up there! Aberdeen are level with Celtic! Yet look a bit closer. Aberdeen missed the chance to go clear yesterday, drawing 2-2 at home with Inverness, and Celtic have two games in hand on them. The first of those takes them to Edinburgh, where they face an awkward test against a decent Hearts side, who are riding high in third. Yet Hearts are 10 points off Celtic. They need a win today to keep this competitiveness.', u'Kick-off: 2pm.', u'Updated at 11.57am GMT']

Here, Nick Wright looks at his difficult start at Old Trafford\u2026', u"Memphis Depay pulled his shirt over his face after gifting Stoke City their opening goal at the Britannia Stadium on Boxing Day, and his disappearing act was complete when he was hauled off at half-time. The 2-0 defeat left Louis van Gaal's future looking more uncertain than ever, but it was an even more embarrassing afternoon for his fellow Dutchman.", u'                    Bojan Krcic and Marko Arnautovic increased the pressure on Louis van Gaal.                ', u'Before conversation turned to Van Gaal\'s future in the Sky Sports studio, former United striker Dwight Yorke addressed the error that allowed Bojan Krkic to put Stoke in front. "Memphis Depay\'s header is the worst diving header I\'ve ever seen," he said. "You have to deal with those situations better, he has to be more decisive."', u"For Depay, it was another setback in what has been a tough start to life in the Premier League. The \xa327.9m winger arrived from PSV Eindhoven as one of Europe's highest-rated young talents, and he raised expectations still further when he asked to wear United's iconic No 7 shirt following Angel Di Maria's departure to Paris Saint-Germain.", u'A stunning double against Club Brugge in August augured well for the 21-year-old, but he has struggled to make an impact since then. Newspaper reports have described him a flashy character who shows up to training driving luxury supercars, but his botched backpass at the Britannia showed a glaring lack of confidence on the pitch. After recent games against Liverpool and Arsenal, it was the third time in 12 Premier League starts that he has been withdrawn at half-time.', u'Van Gaal\'s plodding style is not exactly the ideal environment for an attacker like Depay to flourish, but doubts are growing among supporters, and the manager\'s comments in October look all the more ominous now. "We have seen that some players cannot adapt to the team philosophy," he said. "You cannot know in advance before you buy them. You have to wait and see. That happened with Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao."', u'                    We examine the mounting problems facing Louis van Gaal at Manchester United.                ', u'Last week Depay insisted "failure just isn\'t an option", but his carelessness at the Britannia hardly inspired confidence, and he admits the difference in quality between the Eredivise and the Premier League has taken him by surprise. "It\'s frustrating," he added. "I know I can do a lot better. I just had to settle in and get used to the football, to my new life in England.', u'"When playing in the Premier League, you have to be on top of your game every time. The difference is enormous. Defenders are physically strong, very fit and aren\'t afraid of anything. That was new to me. Good just isn\'t enough when you\'re playing for United."', u'Depay scored 22 goals in 30 league appearances for PSV in 2014/15, but that tally stands at just two in 14 this season. He has had more shots on goal than any other United player, but 15 of his 27 efforts have sailed high or wide, and he has struggled in a creative sense, too, with just seven scoring chances created in 14 appearances so far.', u'United\'s collective struggles have not helped Depay\'s progress, but his troubles have not been isolated to his club either. He was dropped from the Netherlands squad after their failure to qualify for Euro 2016, and manager Danny Blind was publically critical of his temperament. "In football, you must function in a team - and he doesn\'t always do that," said Blind. "I told him that when I called him to say he wasn\'t in the squad. It\'s something he has to learn."', u"Blind's comments echoed those of Van Gaal in October, and they point to a loss of focus from a player who is struggling to cope with adversity for the first time in his career. Van Gaal has claimed Depay needs time to adjust, but the move looked like a perfect match in the summer, and it is troubling that the manager who oversaw his impressive performances at the World Cup has been unable to coax more from him at United.", u"Unlike Van Gaal, Depay does at least have time on his side, but he must look to himself to turn things round. There's plenty of work for United's No 7 to do if he's to start meeting those lofty expectations.", u'\n\n\n\n      \xa92015 Sky\n    ']

bbc ['', u'For a better experience on your device, try our mobile site.', u'\n27 December 2015\r\n\t\t\tLast updated at \r\n\t\t13:49\n', u"    BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.\n", u"    Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is \n        BBC Match of the Day commentator Guy Mowbray.\n\n", u'    Mowbray has predicted five draws on a tight Bank Holiday Monday but has backed Manchester City to beat title rivals Leicester.\n', u'    Lawro is also up against a state-of-the-art super-computer called SAM (Sports Analytics Machine) for the second week running.\n', u'    Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth \n        10 \n\n    points. The exact score earns \n        40 \n\n    points.\n', u'\nOn Boxing Day SAM \r\n\n     predicted \n        three correct results,\n\n     plus \n        two perfect scores\n\n    , to register an impressive \n        110 points\n\n     - equal top on the guest leaderboard!\n', u'    SAM - built by Professor Ian McHale, Dr Georgi Boshnakov and Tarak Kharrat from the Centre for Sports Business at the University of Salford - pipped Lawro, who picked \n        four correct results \n\n    and \n        one perfect score \n\n    to score \n        80 points\n\n    .\n', u'    Who will come out on top this time around? Is man better than machine? Is anyone better than a commentator?\n', u'MONDAY', u'Crystal Palace v Swansea', u'x-x', u'1-1', u'2-0', u'1-0', u'Everton v Stoke', u'x-x', u'2-1', u'1-1', u'1-0', u'Norwich v Aston Villa', u'x-x', u'2-0', u'1-1', u'1-0', u'Watford v Tottenham', u'x-x', u'1-2', u'2-2', u'1-1', u'West Brom v Newcastle', u'x-x', u'2-0', u'2-1', u'1-1', u'Arsenal v Bournemouth', u'x-x', u'2-0', u'3-0', u'2-0', u'Man Utd v Chelsea', u'x-x', u'1-1', u'0-0', u'1-1', u'West Ham v Southampton', u'x-x', u'0-2', u'1-1', u'1-1', u'TUESDAY', u'Leicester v Man City', u'x-x', u'1-2', u'2-3', u'1-1', u'WEDNESDAY', u'Sunderland v Liverpool', u'x-x', u'0-2', u'1-3', u'0-1', u"    We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).\n", u'    Make your own predictions now, compare them to Lawro and other fans and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing \n    \r\nthe BBC Sport Predictor game.\n', u'Lawro', u'1,260', u'Guests', u'930', u' All kick-offs 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated\n', u'    The thing with these games around Christmas is always the quick turnaround. Will sides rotate their teams, move players around? There will be one or two knocks and niggles in every team and Crystal Palace look to be suffering more than most.\n', u"\nYannick Bolasie is out \r\n\n     and he is a massive loss. He is such a good player and supplier, and he is a beast of a man. He's very difficult to stop, he unhinges defences.\n", u"    Swansea's win over West Brom will do them the power of good and they can go and nick a point. They still haven't got a manager but they just needed a game where they got a bit of luck and they did that on Boxing Day.\n", u"     Lawro's prediction: \n\n    1-1\n", u'     Guy Mowbray\'s prediction: \n\n    "Alan Curtis must have conjured up a tremendous effort from his ailing Swans to get their Boxing Day win against West Brom, but I\'ve got to back the other Alan in this one. I\'d fancy Pardew\'s Palace to beat almost anyone at the moment. 2-0."\n', u"     SAM's prediction: \n\n    1-0\n", u'\nMatch preview\n', u"    I was at St James' Park on Boxing Day and Everton just about deserved the win at Newcastle. The thing for Roberto Martinez now is that he can change a game from the bench. He was able to bring on Leon Osman, Gerard Deulofeu and Muhamed Besic and still had Arouna Kone unused, with Phil Jagielka to come back.\n", u'    At Newcastle Aaron Lennon and Kevin Mirallas played and this is probably the strongest squad Martinez has had at Goodison. But they have drawn a lot of games and they need to start winning, starting here.\n', u"    Stoke had an outstanding result against Manchester United but away from home they don't get enough goals for me.\n", u"     Lawro's prediction: \n\n    2-1\n", u"     Guy Mowbray's prediction: \n\n    1-1\n", u"     SAM's prediction: \n\n    1-0\n", u'\nMatch preview\n', u'    After beating Manchester United Norwich may have put up more resistance at Tottenham but they were swatted away after a bright start. Now at home, this could be their biggest game of the season because they can get further away from Aston Villa and get up amongst the pack.\n', u"    Villa can't get three points, they don't create enough chances and lack a goalscorer. Villa are already nine points adrift and we will know by the personnel they sign in January whether they honestly believe they can get out of it or not. Anyone they do bring in will have to be with a view to playing in the Championship if they do get relegated. Or is it a case of when? Would someone like Charlie Austin sign for Villa next month? I don't think so.\n", u"    They will keep going, they will not throw the towel in but they have such a lack of quality it's obvious what will happen to them. We have seen teams turn it around dramatically, look at Leicester last year, but Villa just do not look like scoring at all. They have no goals in them.\n", u"     Lawro's prediction: \n\n    2-0\n", u'     Guy Mowbray\'s prediction: \n\n    "A must-win game for both teams, but you couldn\'t guarantee it with either at the moment. Villa are showing a bit of resilience under their new manager. Enough to get a point? 1-1."\n', u"     SAM's prediction: \n\n    1-0\n", u'\nMatch preview\n', u"    Watford are in danger of stealing Leicester's limelight, they have a real goal threat and are one of a few teams playing 4-4-2. But they have picked up more points away from home then at home this season.\n", u"    Tottenham are looking good but the way the league is now, if you win three games people start talking about the title! It happened with Liverpool the other week. Tottenham won't win the league but they do look like Champions League contenders. They have only lost two games but they draw too many. They look like signing a striker in January in case Harry Kane falls over and that could be a shrewd move.\n", u"     Lawro's prediction: \n\n    1-2\n", u"     Guy Mowbray's prediction: \n\n    2-2\n", u"     SAM's prediction: \n\n    1-1\n", u'\nMatch preview\n', u"    I saw Newcastle on Boxing Day and they look like they might just have enough to avoid relegation, but that's about it. The players are playing for the manager, there's no doubt about that and they got stuck in against Everton. They should have got a point.\n", u"    But I can see West Brom will go and do a job on them, it's what they are particularly good at. Tony Pulis has always been excellent at pigeonholing results, he will have forgotten about the Boxing Day defeat at Swansea and they will be ready to go, and to win.\n", u"     Lawro's prediction: \n\n    2-0\n", u"     Guy Mowbray's prediction: \n\n    2-1\n", u"     SAM's prediction: \n\n    1-1\n", u'\nMatch preview\n', u"    Arsenal always let you down and it happened again at Southampton. They just didn't appear.\n", u"    Arsenal were bullied by Southampton, they had no answer to Shane Long's pace and capitulated towards the end. It looked a game too far for some of the players, which is worrying, but even on a bad day they will create chances. With the players they have got Arsenal should be favourites to win the league from here but the problem is they always throw in a Southampton type result.\n", u'    In a normal season you would worry for their chances but in this season of flux, of change, of inconsistency they will probably get away with it.\n', u"    I love the spirit of Bournemouth and the way that they don't change the way they play for anybody. They run their hearts out every game. They won't get a result at the Emirates though.\n", u"     Lawro's prediction: \n\n    2-0\n", u'     Guy Mowbray\'s prediction: \n\n    "Sorry Cherries, but there has to be an Arsenal response to what happened on the south coast on Boxing Day, and you might cop it. 3-0."\n', u"     SAM's prediction: \n\n    2-0\n", u'\nMatch preview\n', u"    I've never known such a fuss about a game where both sides are so poor. If you look at the history of the Premier League this should be one of the games of the season but instead it will be dull, dull, dull.\n", u"    Louis van Gaal's problem now is that he has no defence. Literally. When he came in he said that he would make Manchester United difficult to beat but right now everyone is rolling them over. It's a strange situation. Jose Mourinho is in the background but is he really a Manchester United manager? I can't see it.\n", u"    How will Van Gaal play this game? He will be safety first, everyone will sit in and they can't really buy a goal at the moment. He is not playing well at the moment but Wayne Rooney will have to come back in, why you would drop him for a game like Stoke away I have no idea.\n", u'    The Van Gaal story will roll on and on but this looks like a bore draw to me.\n', u"     Lawro's prediction:\n\n     1-1\n", u'     Guy Mowbray\'s prediction: \n\n    "I never predict goalless draws, but how could you go with anything else on both clubs\' current (lack of) form? As I\'m at the game, I hope they ram this back in my face with a five or six goal thriller! 0-0."\n', u"     SAM's prediction: \n\n    1-1\n", u'\nMatch preview\n', u'    Southampton looked like they had had the hurry-up from Ronald Koeman when they thrashed Arsenal on Boxing Day night. They have been a bit too nice and very inconsistent but the Arsenal game was a significant win. They convinced themselves that they need to be nasty in footballing parlance, more bullish.\n', u'    West Ham have drawn their last five and are without some key players and are just nursing their way through until Dimitri Payet and Diafra Sakho are back fit. They will be fine this season but I can see the Saints rolling them over.\n', u"     Lawro's prediction: \n\n    0-2\n", u"     Guy Mowbray's prediction: \n\n    1-1\n", u"     SAM's prediction: \n\n    1-1\n", u'\nMatch preview\n', u"    Leicester have done fantastically but when you are top of the league you are a massive target and we saw that at Anfield on Boxing Day, where the atmosphere was lifted by Leicester's visit. The Foxes have been surfing a wave all season but waves die down eventually. We will have a better indication in a couple of weeks where exactly they can finish. Claudio Ranieri has got every single player in the team playing above themselves. That's what a proper manager can do.\n", u'\nManchester City are without Vincent Kompany again \r\n\n     and it is sheer bad luck. Manuel Pellegrini did everything right, bringing him on when they were cruising through a game with no problems and he injured his calf yet again. It sounds really bad for him.\n', u"    It may be time for surgery on it, to have a look inside and see what's what. That's a real blow for them but I think they will go and win at Leicester.\n", u"     Lawro's prediction: \n\n    1-2\n", u'     Guy Mowbray\'s prediction: \n\n    "Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez to get one each, whilst a fit-again Sergio Aguero might get more than one. Game of the week. Game of the season? 2-3."\n', u"     SAM's prediction: \n\n    1-1\n", u'Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.', u'Sunderland lack consistency - Allardyce', u'    I thought \n    \r\nBig Sam\'s quotes \r\n\n     after the defeat at Manchester City were interesting. He has clearly had a look at everybody and he now knows what he needs to bring in during the transfer window. Defensively they are all over the shop. I am sure that when Allardyce took the job he will have told the chairman that he will need "X amount" of money in January.\n', u"    For clubs now, the riches of every season in the top flight are so vast that it makes sense to invest \xc2\xa340m or so in the window if they can stay up. It's a no-brainer. He will be busy.\n", u'    Liverpool played well against Leicester, much more like it and they will have too much for Sunderland. \n    \r\nDaniel Sturridge might even be available \r\n\n     to play some part!\n', u"     Lawro's prediction: \n\n    0-2\n", u"     Guy Mowbray's prediction: \n\n    1-3\n", u"     SAM's prediction: \n\n    0-1\n", u" Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Tom Rostance.\n", u'P18', u'W11', u'D4', u'L3', u'110', u'Sam Tomkins, SAM Super Computer', u'100', u'Wealdstone Raider', u'90', u'Amir Khan', u'70', u'Lawro (average after 18 weeks), Osi Umenyiora', u'60', u'Stuart Broad, Tim Burgess', u'50', u'Mark Radcliffe, Jack Whitehall', u'40', u'Neville, Mumford & Sons', u'30', u'Darren Campbell, Luol Deng, Mark Webber', u'20', u'Graeme Swann', u'10', u'Paul Heaton, Kelly Jones', u"    Lawro's best score: 140 points (week three v Jack Whitehall & week four v Darren Campbell)\n", u"    Lawro's worst score: 20 points (week one v Graeme Swann)\n", u'1.', u'Man City', u'18', u'14', u'3', u'1', u'45', u'+2', u'2.', u'Arsenal', u'18', u'12', u'6', u'0', u'42', u'0', u'3.', u'Chelsea', u'18', u'12', u'5', u'1', u'41', u'+12', u'4.', u'Liverpool', u'18', u'11', u'7', u'0', u'40', u'+4', u'5.', u'Man Utd', u'18', u'9', u'6', u'3', u'33', u'+1', u'6.', u'West Brom', u'18', u'9', u'6', u'3', u'33', u'+7', u'7.', u'Southampton', u'18', u'10', u'2', u'6', u'32', u'+5', u'8.', u'Crystal Palace', u'18', u'8', u'5', u'5', u'29', u'-3', u'9.', u'Tottenham', u'18', u'7', u'7', u'4', u'28', u'-5', u'10.', u'Newcastle', u'18', u'6', u'6', u'6', u'24', u'+8', u'11.', u'Stoke', u'18', u'5', u'5', u'8', u'20', u'0', u'12.', u'Swansea', u'18', u'4', u'8', u'6', u'20', u'+4', u'13.', u'Everton', u'18', u'4', u'6', u'8', u'18', u'-4', u'14.', u'Norwich', u'18', u'5', u'1', u'12', u'16', u'+3', u'15.', u'Bournemouth', u'18', u'4', u'3', u'11', u'15', u'-1', u'16.', u'Sunderland', u'18', u'3', u'6', u'9', u'15', u'+3', u'17.', u'Leicester', u'18', u'2', u'6', u'10', u'12', u'-16', u'18.', u'West Ham', u'18', u'2', u'5', u'11', u'11', u'-8', u'19.', u'Watford', u'18', u'2', u'4', u'12', u'10', u'-12', u'20.', u'Aston Villa', u'18', u'1', u'3', u'14', u'6', u'0', u'\r\n\t\t\tThink you know your football?

"I saw Southampton the previous week against Tottenham and they were poor, without a win in five and it just appeared to be an away win all day long.', u'"It is just such a bad result for them and it once again illustrates that Arsenal need to sign players in the January transfer window, but it will not happen because Wenger is remarkably stubborn and that is why they have not won the title in over a decade.', u'"There have been occasions when they should have won it, but they have not strengthened. Two years ago, they needed a quality player and they signed Kim Kallstrom, who arrived injured after messing around on the beach in Dubai.', u'"And history is repeating itself and I just do not think that things are going to change."', u"It is not all doom and gloom though as far as Arsenal's supporters are concerned, with the Gunners still possessing the quality to win this season's title, according to Wyett.", u'"You look at this current Arsenal squad and it is arguably stronger than the Chelsea squad that won last season\'s title," Wyett said. "But is it nasty enough?', u'"Surely you want one or two characters, with John Terry being the obvious example at Chelsea last season as someone who just gets them together and gives them a kick up the backside.', u'"I am not sure Arsenal have got that. They clearly have got the quality to still win the title, there is absolutely no doubt about that, but it is whether they have got that resilience, which we have seen a few times they have not always had?', u'"But then equally, they do have the ability to just blow teams out of the water, like they did against Olympiakos."', u'\n\n\n\n      \xa92015 Sky\n    ']

bbc ['', u'For a better experience on your device, try our mobile site.', u'  Fletcher 78\u2032  ', u"The win is just West Brom's fourth in their last 14 league matches at home ", u'\n28 December 2015\r\n\t\t\tLast updated at \r\n\t\t17:17\n', u"    West Brom enjoyed their first league win in six games to ease their relegation fears but deepen Newcastle's worries at the bottom of the table. \n", u"    Both teams hit the crossbar, with Paul Dummett's header ricocheting off the woodwork for Newcastle and Victor Anichebe going close for the hosts. \n", u"    Just as a draw seemed inevitable, Darren Fletcher timed his run perfectly to head home Claudio Yacob's cross. \n", u'    But it was poor goalkeeping as Karl Darlow should have done better.  \n', u"    Darlow will look back on his Premier League debut with mixed emotions. He was a late inclusion in Steve McClaren's line up as regular goalkeeper Rob Elliot was withdrawn before kick-off because of illness.\n", u"    The 25-year-old, whose only previous appearance for the Magpies was in the Capital One Cup against Northampton, was uncertain under the high ball throughout and should have held on to Fletcher's header, rather than allowing it to slip through his hands with 12 minutes remaining. \n", u"    It will leave United fans wondering whether their team, who remain in the bottom three, two points adrift of safety, would have earned a point had someone of Elliot's experience been on the pitch.\n", u"    Ironically, Darlow's best contribution came after conceding, acrobatically diving towards his near post to stop substitute Saido Berahino's goal-bound effort. \n", u'    Baggies boss Tony Pulis had warned of a "concertina" effect after two successive defeats against two of the teams below them - Bournemouth and Swansea. \n', u"    Despite his team dominating possession and looking the stronger side in the second half, it seemed as if the Baggies' poor home form would continue - they had only earned eight points at The Hawthorns prior to this match - until Fletcher struck. \n", u"    Scoring has been a problem for Pulis' men of late, but Victor Anichebe - making his first start of the season - added ballast to West Brom's forward line and was a nuisance and a reliable outlet throughout. \n", u"    His performance was only missing a goal, the crossbar preventing him from heading home from a corner. In the first half, Dummett also blocked Anichebe's powerful effort and the industrious striker received a deserved ovation from the home fans as he hobbled off injured before full-time. \n", u'     More to follow. \n\n', u'    Full Time   Match ends, West Bromwich Albion 1, Newcastle United 0.

Well, Chelsea added to the growing list of sides given a torrid afternoon by Watford's prolific strike partnership of Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney as they helped Watford to snatch a 2-2 draw at Chelsea on Boxing Day.", u'A goal each from Deeney and Ighalo helped the Hornets stretch their unbeaten run to five and sit level on points with Manchester United in sixth.', u"Tottenham's impressive showing in a convincing win over Norwich on Boxing Day helped cement their place in the top four, but in-form Watford, complete with their dynamic strike duo, represent a different kind of opposition for Mauricio Pochettino's side.", u'Can Palace extend their unbeaten run to six?

sky [u'\n\n\nFootball\n\n\nNews\n', u'Last Updated: 28/12/15 7:32am', u'Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has lost the support of players and fans, and his days in the job are numbered, according to a Sunday Supplement guest.', u"The Dutchman's 18-month tenure at Old Trafford looks to be nearing an end, with United enduring a dismal run of form which has seen them eliminated from the Champions League, Capital One Cup and stutter in the Premier League.", u'Their Boxing Day defeat at Stoke City\xa0- their fourth consecutive loss in all competitions - left the Reds nine points adrift of leaders Leicester and three points off the top four.', u'Sky Sports News HQ expects Van Gaal to be in the United dugout when Chelsea visit in the Premier League on Monday.', u'But, speaking on the Sunday Supplement, Charlie Wyett of The Sun believes it is now just a matter of time before an "isolated" Van Gaal is relieved of his duties.', u'"Van Gaal has handled the situation badly," Wyett said. "He lost the players a few weeks ago and he\'s lost the majority of the fans now.', u'"He doesn\'t know what to do, he is panicking and it\'s reflecting in his team. He has handled the whole situation badly, last week, for example, when he tried to turn everything on the media and walking out of his press conference.', u'"Maybe that worked temporarily and he got a few more fans behind him but ultimately United are a mess on the pitch.', u'"I thought United would stumble on to the end of the season with Van Gaal and look to make a change then, but now it looks as though it\'s days, maybe a couple of weeks [until he leaves]."', u"The focus now turns to who United will appoint as Van Gaal's successor, should he leave the club, with former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and United assistant manager Ryan Giggs both linked with the job.", u'And Wyett believes United should steer clear of the short-term success Mourinho could bring and gamble on Giggs to see the club through to the end of the season', u'"Ultimately it hasn\'t worked [for Van Gaal] and now United have a problem as to what to do," Wyett added.', u'"If you compare him to Mourinho at Chelsea, in many respects, Mourinho had the support of more fans and certainly more of the players than Van Gaal does.', u'"Mourinho seems an obvious choice [to replace Van Gaal], although not all the fans want him. I think he would sort them out short term, but he is never going to be a long-term option, is he?', u'"At the moment, if and when Van Gaal does go, I think we\'ll see Ryan Giggs come in. United fans that think Giggs will be a blazing success just don\'t know that.', u'"He is inexperienced and, while he may be a great manager, he could be a disaster so that\'s another gamble United have to take in the short term at least."', u'\n\n\n\n      \xa92015 Sky\n    ']

espn [u"You have reached ESPN's UK edition. Stay on current site or go to US version.", u"Former Arsenal man Paul Mariner weighs in on Arsene Wenger's side failing to capitalize on a chance to go top of the league. (2:26)", u'The winter window draws closer with each passing day, and the transfer rumour mill is starting to pick up steam. As always, Transfer Talk has the latest and greatest. See all the summer deals here.', u'Arsenal suffered a huge dent to their Premier League title hopes after falling 4-0 at Southampton, passing up the chance to grab top spot from Leicester with a very public display of cold feet. Arsene Wenger blamed the defeat on refereeing decisions, but he may want to forget those and instead treat himself to a few treats in January.', u'The Star reports Wenger wants Mexico striker Javier "Chicharito" Hernandez after the former Manchester United player\'s stunning Bundesliga form for Bayer Leverkusen, with "sources" suggesting the 27-year-old "would like another crack at the Premier League." The forward has been linked with the Gunners in the past but could have a decision to make if the talk continues.', u'What\'s more, the Star also suggests Wenger has made a "firm inquiry" over Riyad Mahrez to beat Spurs and Man United to the Leicester playmaker, but the move "is set to end in failure."', u'Another potential arrival is Basel defensive midfielder Mohamed Elneny, with the Mail reporting the 23-year-old Egypt international is set to complete a \xa37m switch to North London next month.', u'Though Chicharito and Elneny could give the Gunners a big lift in the race for the title, though one player on his way out could be Mathieu Debuchy. The France international has lost his starting role at right-back to Hector Bellerin, and the Star reports West Brom are keen on a January loan deal.', u"Jose Mourinho's departure from Chelsea cannot be attributed to only one root cause, but one of the key decisions behind Roman Abramovich's decision to sack the Portuguese coach -- who wants the England job after 2016, according to the Mirror -- will surely have been his decision to let two young Belgian talents depart the club too early.", u'Kevin De Bruyne is starring at Manchester City having earned a \xa355 million move from Wolfsburg in the summer, and Romelu Lukaku has attracted the interest of Paris Saint-Germain following fine form at Everton -- and Chelsea want the striker back, according to the Star.', u'The paper reports Didier Drogba has instructed interim manager Guus Hiddink to try and re-sign Lukaku as the "ideal replacement" for Diego Costa. The Star suggests, somewhat optimistically for Chelsea fans, that any potential fee would be \xa332m -- just \xa34m more than what Everton paid for him.', u'Meanwhile, the Mirror reports both Chelsea and Tottenham could seek the services of Jackson Martinez, who is "unsettled" at Atletico Madrid following a summer move from Porto. The 29-year-old Colombia striker has struggled in La Liga, and Diego Simeone "is willing to let him go out on loan for the rest of the season" -- good news for Spurs and the Blues, who are both after forwards.', u'STAR SPORT: Red man walking #tomorrowspaperstoday #bbcpapers pic.twitter.com/26QIgCEfMf', u'- Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) December 26, 2015', u"Manchester United's woeful recent run will surely have a few key players questioning their roles at Old Trafford, especially if the club -- currently sixth in the table -- fail to reach Champions League football for next season.", u'David De Gea missed out on a move to Real Madrid in the summer, and though the goalkeeper signed a new long-term contract at United straight afterward, it appears Los Blancos are ready to return for the Spain international next year. The Star reports a Bernabeu spokesperson as saying: "Real Madrid will not attempt to sign David De Gea in the January window. But the club has proposed to sign him in the summer for next season."', u"Though De Gea's contract will surely contain more than enough bells and whistles regarding another approach from Madrid, it now seems some stars' futures could be dependent on that of Louis van Gaal, who suggested after Saturday's defeat at Stoke that he could quit the club rather than be sacked.

I like what Sheffield Wednesday are building and I think they'll go to the Riverside and do Middlesbrough over.\xa0", u"Carlos Carvalhal has got a wonderful way about him and I love the way he gets his team playing. He always has four or five players interchanging. They fear nobody, whether it's Arsenal or Middlesbrough. They don't change their style and they're in great form having won 4-1 and 3-0 in their last two games.\xa0", u"Middlesbrough will be under huge pressure from their own fans to win this game. This is a serious challenge for them. It's tough to be the top dog and to keep on winning. It's a big burden to carry.", u"Plus, Boro had their game cancelled on Boxing Day, which I don't think actually helps them. Sometimes it's worse missing a game when you've just had a big result like they had at Brighton. That could also yield a little bit of complacency in their game.\xa0", u'OLLIE PREDICTS: 1-2\xa0(Sky Bet odds 16/1)', u'Leeds v Derby, Tuesday 7.45pm, Sky Sports 1 HD', u'December 29, 2015, 7:30pm', u'Live on                         ', u"Derby are showing signs of being champions and Leeds won't be looking forward to this fixture with Paul Clement's team in such fine form. It's now just one defeat in 18 games for the Rams and they've kept six clean sheets in their last seven games.", u"That's no surprise though with a player like Jason Shackell leading the back line.

Their squad is being stretched.', u"MK Dons have always had enough talent to do some damage, it's just been their defence that has let them down. I doubt whether Birmingham have enough going forward to break them down in this game. Nicky Maynard has scored two in his last three games and that should do him the world of good.

When they went up last time, that sort of result never happened. Once you've done it before you're there to be shot at - I think Burnley as a club are better when they're the underdog. When you're successful as a club it can change the whole complexity in terms of expectations from the players and fans. \xa0", u'Previous teams who have been relegated, like Norwich, are much better at dealing with high expectation.\xa0', u'Bristol City can get results on the road, as shown when they beat Middlesbrough earlier this season. \xa0', u'OLLIE PREDICTS: 1-1\xa0(Sky Bet odds 6/1)', u'Charlton v Wolves, Monday 3pm', u"Wolves finally broke their dismal run at home on Boxing Day and that should do them a world of good. Once that young squad get confident, Kenny Jackett will get them zooming up the table. He'll need to bring in some experience in January though. That defence can capitulate, like they did at home to Leeds. It's like a forest fire when that happens. Mistakes spread so fast. \xa0", u"I can't speak highly enough of Jordan Graham on the wing. When you have a player like that in your team, you will create chances. He should be able to work his magic against a Charlton defence that has shipped 13 goals in their last six games.\xa0", u'OLLIE PREDICTS: 0-2\xa0(Sky Bet odds 11/2)', u'Preston v Hull, Monday 3pm', u"Hull have had their blip and they've come through it.

If anyone finishes above Hull City they will have been automatically promoted - the lowest they'll finish will be third. All the best to the rest of the clubs below Derby, Middlesbrough and Hull in terms of automatic promotion.", u'Preston always put up a fight and are tough to break down but Hull breezed past them 2-0 earlier this season.

I hate to say it, but I don't think the squad is strong enough. There's not enough strength in depth to sustain a promotion push. It all hinges on one player and he's not fully fit. Huddersfield are a tough cookie but my heart says QPR will just have enough as players like Leroy Fer can open up teams. \xa0", u"It's about time Fer pulled his finger out and stepped up to the plate. I'd like to see him affect a game. I want a performance out of him. I want to see him score goals and make more offensive runs.

I love him. I would want to play for him. He gets his team playing in a good structure and gets them very organised.', u"Oliver Norwood is making a big name for himself at Reading - he looks good for the first goal here after cracking the woodwork at Wolves on Boxing Day. He's a ticker. He lends in, gets it, lends it, gets it and has a fantastic array of passing. You can tell he's learned his trade at Manchester United.

For two decades, the game was in thrall to this ridiculous little Caesar and the corrupt brown envelope culture he employed to keep a grip on power by misusing the immense riches that football brought his organisation, an organisation that became a byword for the ugly side of the beautiful game.', u"This year will also be remembered for its triumphs, including Great Britain's brilliant Davis Cup victory", u'Tyson Fury celebrates after he defeated Wladimir Klitschko to become the world heavyweight champion', u'Jessica Ennis-Hill won World Championship gold in the heptathlon in Beijing, 13 months after giving birth', u'Blatter had turned football governance into a Kafkaesque nightmare. He was the bad dream we could never quite wake up from, masterminding a series of obscene decisions that may yet sound the death knell for international football as it struggles to maintain its relevance against the incursions of the club game.', u"The most obscene of all these was FIFA's decision, backed by Platini, to award the 2022 summer World Cup to a desert nation, Qatar, a move so horrifically misguided that the foul stench of bribery and corruption emanating from it made everyone who loved football feel sick.", u"When Swiss police descended upon the Baur au Lac Hotel in Zurich in May and arrested some of FIFA's crooks, the dominos began to fall. FIFA were so institutionally corrupt they still re-elected Blatter as their president a couple of days later but this time not even he could survive. Platini's disgracing soon followed. Football breathed a long sigh of relief.", u"But if there was no equivocation about the fall of Blatter, there was a great sense of regret and sadness about one of the year's other central stories, the abject failure of the England team at the Rugby World Cup and the resultant resignation of their coach, Stuart Lancaster.", u"Michel\xa0Platini's disgracing soon followed Blatter's as football breathed a long sigh of relief in 2015", u"Stuart Lancaster oversaw England's disastrous pool-stage exit from the Rugby World Cup this year", u"The tournament was supposed to have been a wonderful showcase for English rugby and Lancaster's dream was to field not just a winning side but a team of men worthy of the adulation they would receive if they lifted the Webb Ellis Trophy in October. I spoke to him at England's base a couple of weeks before the tournament began and Lancaster mentioned that his teenage son had become disillusioned with football after reading about the misdeeds of a prominent player who was one of his heroes.", u"He didn't want that for rugby. He made great play of creating a side who would reconnect with the English public, a team who would work off the pitch to deserve their profile. When players fell foul of his disciplinary code, however important they were to the team, they were sent into exile.", u'It was a brave plan. It was admirable in many ways. But some of the wiser analysts began to fret about the amount of talent that was being denied to England and about the lack of responsibility being accorded to the players in what they said was a schoolmasterly regime.', u"Sam Burgess was drafted in to the side but the wheels were wrenched off England's chariot at Twickenham", u"There was also disquiet among rugby union's traditionalists about the faith Lancaster was placing in rugby league convert Sam Burgess and, after an opening victory against Fiji, the wheels were wrenched off England's chariot with a shattering defeat by Wales at Twickenham.", u"Lancaster reeled. He did not seem to know his best team. The pressure was intense and the coach seemed to freeze in the spotlight's glare. When England were crushed by Australia a week after the Wales defeat, England became the first sole host nation to exit the Rugby World Cup at the pool stages.", u'Lancaster was excoriated for his failings. The criticism was unsparing but most of it was fair. Some of us hoped he would be given the chance to see his young team mature into a side who may be a force at the 2019 World Cup in Japan but that was fanciful. Several tortured weeks after the tournament finished, won by Dan Carter and the mighty All Blacks, Lancaster was out.', u"Blatter's influence had become so destructive within FIFA that his downfall felt like a huge triumph", u'What does that kind of failure do to a man, to get to the top of your profession, to lead your country into a home World Cup and then to see the ground fall away from beneath your feet? My guess is Lancaster deals with it better than Blatter copes with his fall.', u"Lancaster always had a life outside the England rugby team whereas FIFA was Blatter's fiefdom. The picture of the fallen president arriving at a press conference last week with a plaster on his face was a neat symbol of a wounded man. I don't know if he ever loved football but, like all petty despots, he loved power and his power corrupted him.", u"Sport has witnessed many great victories this year but Blatter's influence had become so destructive that his downfall felt like the greatest of triumph of them all.", u'\n                                \tShare what you think\n                                ', u'The comments below have been moderated in advance.', u'\n                        The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n                    ', u'By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.', u'Copy link to paste in your message', u'Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd', u'Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group']

See all the summer deals here.', u'With just Wayne Rooney (out of form) and Anthony Martial (just 19) to choose from up front at Manchester United, manager Louis van Gaal is looking for another striker in January.', u"Clearly he's been looking at Chelsea's Christmas list too, as United are keen on a \xa310 million bid for Yoshinori Muto, who nearly joined the Blues last summer, according to The Daily Mirror.", u'Instead, saying he wanted guaranteed first-team football, Muto went to Germany and has scored seven goals in 14 appearances for Mainz this season.', u'Mainz might "fit his level" but the Japan international would surely be foolish to turn down a club like United if they come in.', u"When you have unlimited wealth, it's quite a task to pick the right players for your club.

And you can't really think bigger than Ballon d'Or shor-tlistee Neymar.", u'Mundo Deportivo say that once Pep is tied down, the Barcelona winger will be the next big name to arrive at the Etihad.', u"Quite what that means for the rest of City's expensive stars is another question.", '', u"It is tough to break into the first-team at Barcelona, so you wouldn't begrudge a young player a move if he can't knock the likes of Neymar, Lionel Messi or Luis Suarez onto the bench.", u"AS have news that North London's finest are eyeing Barca's famed La Masia academy with a view to bringing in two of its top stars.", u"Tottenham want 20-year-old attacking midfielder Sandro after losing Cameroon star Clinton N'Jie to injury for the next few months, while Arsenal's quest for a defensive midfielder has led them to Sergi Samper.", u'Sandro\'s "mobility and competitive spirit" have apparently caught the eye of Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino, who isn\'t afraid of the \xac12m pricetag; while Samper could be available for as little as \xac10m which always makes Arsene Wenger happy.', u'Real Madrid coach Rafa Benitez has been in the news recently, with speculation over his future at the Bernabeu a constant while fans continue to boo from the stands. But with Jose Mourinho hovering around for any potential vacancy, another former Madrid boss has ruled himself out of a return.', u'Spanish television station Cuatro asked Fabio Capello about going back and he replied: "Is this a joke?", before bursting into laughter.', u'Adding: "No, no, no. I don\'t want to talk about this because it\'s a joke. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."', u'- Arsene Wenger says he was right to only sign ONE outfield player last summer.
